Other images to have been shot include a Zumba class from Bristol and wheelchair rugby players from Wales.\nThe BBC said the portraits will feature \u201cdifferent groups of people coming together across the UK, united by their shared passions and interests\u201d.\nThe groups have been selected \u201cto reflect the diversity of modern Britain and the changing mood of the nation through significant moments in the calendar year\u201d.\nThe images, of which there are expected to be about 20, will replace the circle-themed idents that have aired since 2006. The BBC came under fire at the time for spending \u00a31.2m on the images, which included a family of computer-generated hippos practising synchronised swimming, surfers, stunt motorbike riders and kite-fliers.\nThe BBC declined to say how much the new idents cost, but said they were made in-house.

So far it has specialised in detox breaks for adults, but its first teenage weekend will open in Somerset during the Easter holidays.\nSmartphones are stealing our time. This new year, I want to claim it back | Marcus Gilroy-Ware Read more\nFounder Tanya Goodin has toured secondary schools to talk to children about managing their online time in a healthier way. \u201cMore and more have been coming up to me and asking \u2018How do I know if I\u2019m addicted?\u2019\u201d she said, \u201cand \u2018How much time is too much time online?\u2019 A bit of logging off and mindfulness before they launch into the summer exam season ought to be a good experience.\u201d\nGoodin carried out a survey of more than 500 young people aged 13 to 18. Of those, 29% said they spent more than eight hours a day online while 36% admitted they regularly fell asleep with their phone or laptop in bed. Two-thirds (67%) said they went to their phone when they were bored and nearly 60% revealed they used their phone as a crutch in an uncomfortable social situation.\nEliza, 16, a year 11 pupil in Hampshire, is one of those keen to sign up. She is currently revising for her mock GCSEs, but is struggling to get anything done. The problem, she says, is that she cannot stay off her phone for more than 20 minutes. \u201cI\u2019m constantly checking it and flicking through stuff. I wish I could bring myself to delete all my apps, or just turn the phone off, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s quite scary,\u201d she says.\n\u201cOnce you get into the habit you\u2019re always waiting \u2013 there\u2019s always a set amount of \u2018likes\u2019 you\u2019re trying to get. There\u2019s always certain standards you have to meet. There\u2019s a lot of pressure in that sense.\u201d\nGetting children off screens is already big business in China. Places like Beijing\u2019s Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre, founded by a former officer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, are run more like military boot camps than retreats. The children are woken at 5am and there is a focus on discipline, obedience and silence (sometimes even solitary confinement).\n\u201cThe kids get dragged there kicking and screaming\u201d, says Goodin, who says her camps will take a softer approach. Activities will focus on team building, silent walks and creative pastimes like photography, painting and cookery. As with her adult retreats, the teenagers will be required to leave all their devices at the door.\n\u201cI imagine it will be quite bad tempered and snarly to start with,\u201d she says. \u201cThe first 24 hours are the most difficult but then I expect them to adapt very quickly.\u201d\nAt \u00a3500 for a three-night stay, it will not be accessible to all. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to happen for children with parents who are switched on enough to care, or able enough to afford it,\u201d says Shelagh O\u2019Connell, head of English at a prominent west London school. O\u2019Connell, who has been teaching English for 20 years, has seen a major dip in the attention span of her pupils over the past five years and believes much of it is down to a rampant social media culture.\n\u201cThe children have to be plugged into their social feed all the time, so they\u2019re caught in a bubble,\u201d she says. Pupils are less able to memorise poetry verses, take dictated notes in class or even make simple observations, like describing the colours of autumnal leaves.\n\u201cTeaching has become focused on keeping kids\u2019 attention and always having visuals in front of them,\u201d she says.\nO\u2019Connell agrees with Goodin that children are more clued up about technology dependency than many adults give them credit for. One of her pupils was so concerned about failing a series of crucial exams that he gave her his mobile phone for safe keeping between Easter and study leave, she says.\n\u201cHe was coming in well slept and polite, and he didn\u2019t ask for it back,\u201d adds O\u2019Connell. \u201cHe passed the exams and his mother was really grateful to me because she hadn\u2019t had to battle him at home.\u201d\nSo should schools be looking at their own digital detox initiatives, especially around exam times?\nDr Richard Graham, a consultant psychiatrist at the Nightingale hospital in London, thinks so. Digital detox retreats in Somerset will be good for \u201cwashing out the toxins,\u201d he says. But schools need a \u201csystem-wide approach, with clean times and clean zones where everyone switches off\u201d.\nWith exams looming, Eliza, for one, would welcome something that forces her to resist her social media impulses. \u201cIt all started off as a place to make new friends, but it\u2019s turned into something that\u2019s more about seeking validation,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I put myself through it.\u201d", "lang": "en", "date_time": "2017-01-01T00:05:40", "intro": "Pupils who struggle to stay away from their mobiles and laptops can take part in a pioneering camp", "topic": "Children|The Observer|Social media|Smartphones|news", "author": "Rob Walker", "source": "guardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/01/digital-detox-teenagers-pioneering-camp", "category": ""},
{"title": "My fellow Scots, I have seen the future, so read on\u2026", "content": "There are many reasons why I feel I must review my exposure to, and deployment of, social media in 2017. Not the least of these is all those long pronouncements that people insist on handing down on why 2016 was a bastard of a year. These windy sermons are written in the style of the Gettysburg address and can cover anything from the denouement of so many celebrities to the bad attitude of a rogue check-out assistant at Tesco. People who seemingly have no problem with the UK government\u2019s immigration policies or who think we should be cracking down hard on benefit cheats while ignoring corporate tax avoidance nevertheless insist on telling the rest of us why Donald Trump and Brexit have made 2016 such a disastrous year.\nAnd while I can only sympathise with the families of George Michael, David Bowie and Prince for their sad losses in 2016, I dislike how their deaths, in the eyes of otherwise sane people, renders the year a bad one. For those ordinary people who had to mourn the deaths of their own loved ones, the death of a distant A-lister doesn\u2019t make the year any worse. The year 2016 was a momentous one, but it wasn\u2019t significantly better or worse than most other years.\nI predict that 2017 will be just as momentous as 2016 and that quite a lot of famous people will die during its course. Don\u2019t hold me, though, to any of the following predictions about how the year will unfold.\nIn February, following a long campaign by the Humanist Society in Scotland, the SNP government will pass a law making it an offence for parents to compel their children to walk past churches without offering them at least two other route options. A Scottish government spokeswoman says: \u201cScotland is a diverse and inclusive country but we can\u2019t have impressionable young minds exposed to ideas about unconditional love and turning the other cheek to your enemies.\u201d Patrick Harvie, a co-convener of Scotland\u2019s Green party welcomes the move and reveals that plans are well advanced to force broadcasters to provide a warning before screening any programmes that depict Christian worship.\nThis March, a proposal will be unveiled that is expected to lead to a long-awaited revolution in Scottish football. From now on, no person will be admitted to a Scottish Football Association (SFA) coaching course until he can first demonstrate that he can walk and talk at the same time. This is expected to disqualify about 90% of Scottish football\u2019s youth coaches and ensure that the international team can begin the task of reducing the gap between ourselves and the likes of Benin and Mali. An SFA spokesman says: \u201cPassing the ball quickly to members of your own team has long been recognised as a fundamental principle of the modern game and we feel that Scotland is now ready to embrace this concept.\u201d\nPassing quickly to your own team has long been a fundamental principle ... we feel Scotland is now ready to embrace this\nAfter Scotland\u2019s local government elections in May 2017, not a single council will remain under Labour\u2019s control. In Glasgow, they will come in third behind the Tories. Kezia Dugdale, the Labour leader in Scotland, says: \u201cIn retrospect, the decision to hand out free union jack mugs to the party faithful bearing the slogan \u2018Socialism Is for Losers\u2019 might have upset our core vote in working-class areas.\u201d\nJune will be a quiet month, but it will end with the news that Nigel Farage has been successful in his application to become a bellhop at Trump Tower after his intense lobbying of the newly installed US president. \u201cI feel I can be just as effective a lickspittle in US/UK relations as Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher were,\u201d he says.\nThe summer will see the revelation of an explosive email exchange between the offices of two senior SNP strategists. \u201cLook, [name redacted], I want independence for Scotland as much as the next chiel, but almost 200 special advisers aren\u2019t far away from collecting their pensions. Independence could see us booted out of government and the chaps losing out on some entitlements. NS advice is just to keep hiding behind Brexit.\u201d\nWhat can it all mean?\nThe nation will be in mourning in September after Edinburgh loses its status as a Unesco world heritage site. The development comes after Edinburgh city council plans to erect a giant concrete wheelie bin at the east end of Princes Street, which will entirely overshadow Calton Hill. \u201cWe feel that this conveys a message about Edinburgh\u2019s commitment to the environment. The concrete will be sculpted in a Greek, neoclassical style, in keeping with other buildings on Calton Hill,\u201d a spokesman explains.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Could the view of Edinburgh\u2019s Calton Hill become obscured by an enormous concrete-sculpted wheelie bin?

The figure, whose name is known to the Observer, is believed to be in hiding in a safe house after he tells shocked party executive members of his decision. Lord Foulkes of Cumnock says: \u201cWe feel this sets a bad precedent for the party.

{"title": "Allan Williams obituary", "content": "In 1960, the Liverpool entrepreneur Allan Williams arranged for a fledgling group, the Beatles, to undertake a residency at a club in the red light district of Hamburg. It transformed the way they played and set them on a course that was to change popular music. Williams, who has died aged 86, later fell out with the band, leaving the field clear for the record store manager Brian Epstein to become their manager.\nWilliams warned Epstein to have nothing to do with them. He became known as \u201cthe man who gave the Beatles away\u201d, and he would recount his experiences in pubs, clubs and Beatle conventions and, indeed, to anyone who would listen. He was a superb raconteur, who undoubtedly embellished his tales, but never out of self-interest \u2013 it was simply to make his remarkable tales even more entertaining.\nWilliams was born into a Welsh family in the Liverpool suburb of Bootle. His father, Dick, was a joiner who also promoted concerts. When Allan was still young, his mother, Annie (nee Cheetham), died giving birth to twins, who also died, and it was some years before Allan learned that the person he called his mother, Millie (nee Twigg), was actually his stepmother. On leaving school, he worked as a plumber, and in his spare time sang as a tenor with the Bentley Amateur Operatic Society, where he met Beryl Chang, a domestic science teacher, in 1953. They married two years later despite encountering hostility from both their families to a mixed-race marriage.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Allan Williams, left, with, from left: his wife, Beryl, Lord Woodbine, Stuart Sutcliffe, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Pete Best at the Arnhem War Memorial, in the Netherlands, in the early 1960s. Photograph: Keystone USA/Rex/Shutterstock\nKeen to follow the London trend for teenage coffee bars, Williams opened the Jacaranda in Liverpool in September 1958. Some students at the nearby art college, including Stuart Sutcliffe, were asked to paint the toilets and provide a mural for the cellar. Sutcliffe was then a guitarist with the Beatles, and the band made early appearances at the Jacaranda.\nWhen Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent played the Liverpool Empire in March 1960, their British manager, Larry Parnes, agreed to organise a one-off concert at Liverpool Stadium with Williams that May. Cochran was killed in a road crash in April, so Williams added local groups to the bill, but not the Beatles. He did not consider them good enough.\nAfter the concert, Parnes asked Williams to organise an audition for potential backing groups for his artists. As a result, the Beatles went to Scotland for a week to back the singer Johnny Gentle. As they had no drummer at the time, Williams found them a stand-in, Tommy Moore. Moore hated John Lennon\u2019s sarcasm, however, and on returning to Liverpool decided to stay with his job at Garston Bottle Works. Williams had a share in the New Cabaret Artists\u2019 club, a strip joint in Liverpool, and booked the Beatles to accompany a Manchester stripper for a week. When he sold the venue, he and his partner, a calypso singer called Lord Woodbine (Harold Phillips), went to Amsterdam and then Hamburg to assess the club life.\nAt the Indra in Hamburg, Williams heard a German band attempting rock\u2019n\u2019roll and told the club\u2019s owner, Bruno Koschmider, that he could supply Liverpool bands to do a better job. He recommended the Beatles, not because they were good but because they were available \u2013 they did not have day jobs.\nA few weeks later, Williams was with another Liverpool group, the Seniors, at the 2i\u2019s coffee bar in London and found Koschmider there, looking for \u201cthe Peetles\u201d. As a result, the first Liverpool band to play in Hamburg was the Seniors, with the vocalists Derry Wilkie and Freddie Fowell (later better known as Freddie Starr). Koschmider wanted more. Howie Casey, the Seniors\u2019 saxophonist, told Williams not to send \u201cthat bum group, the Beatles\u201d because of their inexperience.\nWilliams and Beryl drove the Beatles to Hamburg. The band did well but fell out first with Koschmider, when they moved to a rival club, the Top Ten, and then with Williams, over commission on subsequent appearances. Williams felt he was still entitled to 10%, but they thought otherwise, and they parted company.\nIn 1960, Williams opened the first beat club in Liverpool city centre, also called the Top Ten. It burned down within a week, but his late-night cabaret venue, the Blue Angel, thrived and in 1963, he promoted a beat festival at the Stanley Stadium, one of the earliest open-air rock concerts in the UK, perhaps the first. He admitted he had wasted his big chance, though. He watched the Beatles on the Royal Variety Performance in November 1963: \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew I\u2019d blown it. I threw a cushion at the TV \u2013 I wish I\u2019d had a brick.\u201d\nIn 1975 Williams wrote his autobiography, The Man Who Gave the Beatles Away, with the journalist Bill Marshall. When he told Marshall that he could not remember any more anecdotes, Marshall invented some for his approval and Williams was soon telling them as his own. After a series of personal appearances to promote his book, in 1977 Williams, in partnership with the disc-jockey from the Cavern Club in Liverpool, Bob Wooler, organised the first Beatles convention. It promised an appearance by a Beatle. The tension mounted as the audience wondered who it would be. It turned out to be Moore. To make matters worse, Moore could remember little about his time with the Beatles.\nWilliams himself appeared at many conventions around the world, and sold antiques and memorabilia at flea markets. He was always cheerful but he drank too much and Beryl told him to leave. He got together with Wooler\u2019s former wife, Beryl, and he would refer to them as Beryl 1 and Beryl 2. Beryl 2 died in 2003.\nIn 2002 a play based on Williams\u2019s experiences, The Man Who Gave the Beatles Away, written and directed by Ronan Wilmot, was premiered in Dublin. A second volume of his memoirs, The Fool on the Hill, this time written with Lew Baxter, was launched at the Beatles festival in Liverpool in 2003.\nOver the years, Williams had been vituperative about his relationship with the Beatles, but, in order to promote the book and prompted by Baxter, he became a changed man. He told audiences: \u201cI am a millionaire. I am a millionaire of memories and no one can take that from me.\u201d\nHe is survived by his wife, Beryl, and his son, Justin, and daughter, Leah.\n\u2022 Allan Richard Williams, entrepreneur, born 21 February 1930; died 30 December 2016", "lang": "en", "date_time": "2017-01-01T13:50:35", "intro": "Liverpool entrepreneur known as \u2018the man who gave the Beatles away\u2019", "topic": "The Beatles|Liverpool|Pop and rock|Wales|obituaries", "author": "Spencer Leigh", "source": "guardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/01/allan-williams-obituary", "category": ""},
{"title": "Universal basic income trials being considered in Scotland", "content": "Scotland looks set to be the first part of the UK to pilot a basic income for every citizen, as councils in Fife and Glasgow investigate trial schemes in 2017.\nThe councillor Matt Kerr has been championing the idea through the ornate halls of Glasgow City Chambers, and is frank about the challenges it poses.\n\u201cLike a lot of people, I was interested in the idea but never completely convinced,\u201d he said. But working as Labour\u2019s anti-poverty lead on the council, Kerr says that he \u201ckept coming back to the basic income\u201d.\nShould we scrap benefits and pay everyone \u00a3100 a week? Read more\nKerr sees the basic income as a way of simplifying the UK\u2019s byzantine welfare system. \u201cBut it is also about solidarity: it says that everyone is valued and the government will support you. It changes the relationship between the individual and the state.\u201d\nThe concept of a universal basic income revolves around the idea of offering every individual, regardless of existing welfare benefits or earned income, a non-conditional flat-rate payment, with any income earned above that taxed progressively. The intention is to provide a basic economic platform on which people can build their lives, whether they choose to earn, learn, care or set up a business.\nThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has suggested that it is likely to appear in his party\u2019s next manifesto, while there has been a groundswell of interest among anti-poverty groups who see it as a means of changing not only the relationship between people and the state, but between workers and increasingly insecure employment in the gig economy.\nKerr accepts that, while he is hopeful of cross-party support in Glasgow, there are \u201cmonths of work ahead\u201d, including first arranging a feasibility study in order to present a strong enough evidence base for a pilot. \u201cBut if there is ever a case to be made then you need to test it in a place like Glasgow, with the sheer numbers and levels of health inequality. If you can make it work here then it can work anywhere.\u201d\nThe idea has its roots in 16th-century humanist philosophy, when it was developed by the likes of Thomas More, but in its modern incarnation it has lately enjoyed successful pilots in India and Africa.\nDespite its utopian roots, champions believe that this is an idea whose time has come, particularly in Scotland where the governing SNP voted in support of a basic income at their spring conference (although the proposal has yet to make it into their manifesto).\nAt the heart of any experiment with basic income is money: how much should people get and where will it come from? Kerr says his instinct is to base the amount on similar calculations to those made for the living wage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about having more than just enough to pay the bills. But part of the idea of doing a pilot is to make mistakes and also find out what is acceptable to the public. There will be a lot of resistance to this. We shouldn\u2019t kid ourselves. Part of the problem is we\u2019re working against a whole discourse of deserving and undeserving poor.\u201d\nAs for where the money comes from, \u201cthe funding question is always the big one, and really will depend upon the approach a pilot takes,\u201d says Jamie Cooke, head of RSA Scotland, which has been spearheading research on the subject across the UK.\nDrawing on the experience of similar projects ongoing in Finland, Utrecht in the Netherland and Ontario in Canada, Cooke suggests: \u201cIt could be funding from particular trusts, it could be individual philanthropic funding, as we have seen in the States, or it could be a redirection of the existing welfare spend.\u201d Obviously the latter is much harder to do in a pilot, although that will be happening in Finland next year where the experiment is being taken forward by the national government.\nUniversal basic income is not a magic solution, but it could help millions | Anthony Painter Read more\nAs the Scottish government consults on what it has described as \u201cthe biggest transfer of powers since devolution began\u201d \u2013 the devolution of around \u00a32.7bn, or 15% of the total Scottish benefits bill, affecting 1.4 million people \u2013 both Kerr and Cooke believe that this is an ideal moment to consider the basic income seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s a time to be testing out new \u2013 or rather old \u2013 ideas for a welfare system that genuinely supports independence,\u201d says Kerr.\nCooke likewise believes that cross-party support is key, pointing to the fact that the leader of the Conservative group on Fife council has joined forces with the Fairer Fife Commission, the council\u2019s independent poverty advisory group which initially recommended the trial, with the aim of designing a pilot within the next six months.\nScotland was recently added to the list of \u201cplaces to watch\u201d for basic income activity by the Basic Income Earth Network, founded by the radical economist Guy Standing, whose hugely influential book The Precariat identified an emerging social class suffering the worst of job insecurity and most likely to be attracted to rightwing populism.\n\u201cThe thing about Scotland is that they really understand the precariat,\u201d says Standing, who recently visited the country to meet civil servants, local authorities and campaigners to discuss a basic income. \u201cThe sense of insecurity, the stagnating living standards, all of those things are clear in Scotland and the fact that so many within the SNP are supportive means there\u2019s a real opportunity to do a pilot in Scotland.\u201d\nThe momentum is there, he says, and once it is framed around a desire for greater social justice \u201cthen you get away from the stale debate about whether if you give people the basic income then they will be lazy\u201d.\n\u201cPeople relate to the idea that everyone should have a social dividend. Everywhere I go, it\u2019s the communities that feel left behind by globalisation that are most interested [in the idea of a basic income]. We have seen a sea-change in attitudes.\n\u201cThis sense of alarm about populist rightwing politics has brought more people to thinking we need to do something to provide better security for people. We are risking our economic and political stability if we don\u2019t do something about it.\u201d", "lang": "en", "date_time": "2017-01-01T09:24:14", "intro": "Two councils, Fife and Glasgow, are investigating idea of offering everyone a fixed income regardless of earnings", "topic": "Welfare|Benefits|Scotland|Local government|Local politics|Scottish politics|news", "author": "John O'Farrell", "source": "guardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/01/universal-basic-income-trials-being-considered-in-scotland", "category": ""},

But in late April 2016, as the throng of refugees jostled on to the waiting boat, 13-year-old Dawit somehow went ahead and was separated from his mother and brother. Panicking, he attempted to leap overboard as the vessel pulled away from the Egyptian coast. Witnesses described the young Eritrean as \u201cpetrified\u201d and sobbing as he watched his mother and younger brother, who were still on the shore.\nDawit survived the crossing \u2013 unlike more than 5,000 refugees who drowned while making it in 2016 \u2013 arriving in Sicily before being taken to a reception centre in Rome. From there, he called his mother twice a day. The two were close, a bond amplified following his father\u2019s disappearance shortly after joining the Eritrean military.\nBut Dawit\u2019s mother and brother never turned up. Their boat belatedly left north Africa on 3 June 2016. Chronically overcrowded, it was rocking alarmingly as it headed for Italy. Eventually it broke apart and sank.

But the orphan\u2019s personal anguish is also about to affect the destiny of potentially thousands of child refugees. On 19 December, in a so-far undisclosed but groundbreaking judgment, the high court in Britain ordered that Dawit be brought to the UK immediately and reunited with his aunt in north London.\nDelivering another legal defeat for the Home Office over its approach to the refugee crisis, the judgment carries profound implications for thousands of unaccompanied minors in Italy and throughout Europe. It allows the court to intervene when the Dublin regulation, designed to reunite unaccompanied refugee children with their families, is failing to protect the \u201cbest interests\u201d of vulnerable minors.\nAlthough attention has been focused on France and the aftermath of the Calais camp being dismantled, huge numbers of unaccompanied child refugees have gathered in Italy. UN figures reveal 19,000 minors arrived there between January and October 2016, an 88% rise on the same period in 2015. A sizeable number are believed to have legal rights to family reunification in the UK, but campaigners say the system is broken. None were transferred from Italy in 2014 and 2015, and only three in 2016.\nIt is almost certain that Dawit, who turned 14 last month, would have remained alone and traumatised in Rome had he not been identified by volunteers working for Safe Passage, a programme of Citizens UK, the social action charity chiefly responsible for the successful transfer of children from Calais to Britain and whose court triumph last January kickstarted the resettlement of minors in northern France to the UK. The belief is that Dawit\u2019s case will act as a similar catalyst for children in Italy and Europe.\n\u201cThe courts have given the government legal, but also moral direction in how they should approach this serious and desperate issue,\u201d said Rabbi Janet Darley of Citizens UK, which last year founded Safe Passage.\nDarley said the Home Office\u2019s attempt to block Dawit\u2019s case was illustrative. \u201cYou do not leave a sick and bereaved child in the road to deter others from trying to cross. Particularly when it is our own government\u2019s failure to make the Dublin regulations work that has blocked the pavements.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Migrants arrive in Palmero after being rescued by a Norwegian ship while attempting to cross the Mediterranean. Photograph: Antonio Melita/Rex/Shutterstock\nDawit, whose identity cannot be revealed for legal reasons, is expected to arrive in London imminently, where he will stay with his British aunt, Sesuna. For her, it is the first positive development since travelling to Rome on 7 June and telling Dawit that his mother and brother were dead.\nSix months on, the teenager is unable to rationalise his loss. \u201cHe has found it extremely difficult to process this news and has appeared dazed and in disbelief,\u201d say court documents chronicling his grief. Psychological assessments confirm Dawit is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, a condition that deteriorates each day he is kept apart from his aunt. \u201cThe ongoing separation from his family is causing this vulnerable child harm and deep suffering. He is frightened and highly distressed,\u201d say the legal documents.\nDawit\u2019s plight has also highlighted the attitude of the Home Office to unaccompanied minors. The Dublin regulations were designed to protect the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d, but the court documents suggest a profoundly different approach. On 26 September, Dawit\u2019s lawyers wrote to the Home Office outlining details of his \u201ccompelling case\u201d, along with references to his declining mental state, suggesting the child be brought to London by 18 October. The Home Office did not respond. On 10 October his lawyers\u2019s wrote again, this time requesting a transfer by 31 October. Again there was no reply. Critics say it is no surprise that the court judgment found the Home Office \u201cacted unlawfully\u201d in light of its obligations to the young Eritrean. So far, through the tenacious championing of Safe Passage, 220 children have been given refuge in the UK using the Dublin agreement.\nDawit\u2019s lawyer, Mark Scott of Bhatt Murphy, hopes the court triumph will transform the dynamic with thousands of minors benefiting. \u201cThis case sends a very clear message to European governments and the European commission: effective systems must be established so that the rights to family reunification in the European regulations and directives are accessible for children.\u201d\nFor Dawit, broken by trauma and bewildered by the reluctance of adults to reunite him with the remaining members of his family, the legal victory offers the chance of a new life and an opportunity to heal.", "lang": "en", "date_time": "2017-01-01T00:05:40", "intro": "A legal victory for the Safe Passage charity on behalf of one Eritrean teenager could save unaccompanied child refugees across Europe", "topic": "Guardian and Observer charity appeal 2016|The Observer|Refugees|Eritrea|Africa|Italy|Europe|news", "author": "Mark Townsend", "source": "guardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/01/eritrean-refugee-tragedy-guardian-observer-appeal-safe-passage-charity", "category": ""},
{"title": "The five innovations that shaped sustainability in 2016", "content": "From edible cutlery to drone vaccines, we celebrate the technologies and innovations that promise to advance sustainability efforts in the years ahead\nIt\u2019s been a rollercoaster of a year. In the world of sustainability alone, we saw the landmark Paris climate change agreement come into force; learned how rising temperatures in the Arctic are negatively impacting local residents; and watched as the world\u2019s top conservationists mourned the declining state of Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef.\nAnd then, a bombshell: a certain \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian\u201d won the US presidential race and called into question everything from America\u2019s basic environmental protection to Nasa\u2019s ongoing climate change research. Corporate America took evasive action, signing a letter telling Donald Trump it is serious about sustainability, while others began unpacking Trump\u2019s emphasis on \u201cclean coal\u201d and what it really means for the future of energy in the US.\nBut it hasn\u2019t all been doom and gloom. While the rest of the world struggled to come to terms with the aforementioned craziness, innovators, scientists and tech heads worked quietly from the sidelines to come up with solutions. And some succeeded: from a trashcan that sucks up ocean garbage to a drone that delivers vaccines to endangered ferrets, here are our top picks for this year\u2019s best sustainable tech.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Peter Ceglinski, left, and Andrew Turton invented the Seabin device, which traps garbage floating around marinas and docks. Photograph: Seabin\nIt\u2019s no secret that our oceans are turning into swirling garbage dumps. There are some 5.25tn pieces of floating plastic debris in the oceans right now, and it\u2019s estimated that some 8m metric tons of plastic waste enter global waters every year.\nEarlier this year, Peter Ceglinski and Andrew Turton, two surfers from Australia, came up with a device they\u2019re calling the Seabin \u2013 a kind of submersible garbage can that captures floating trash. Picture a cylinder, with the upper opening just below the surface of the water. An electric pump draws water through the bottom of the cylinder, creating a vortex around the upper edge that pulls in water and floating trash. A bag filter, made of natural material, collects the trash and allows water to pass through.\nAfter raising more than $267,000 in an Indiegogo campaign to help build the device, Ceglinski and Turton are keen to start selling the Seabin to marinas around the world. First stop: Miami, Florida, where Miami Beach\u2019s marinas manager wants to start using the Seabin in 2017 to counter the bags, bottles, paper plates and forks found daily in the water.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A startup has invented a DNA analyzer that could potentially revolutionize healthcare in the developing world. Photograph: QuantuMDx\nEarlier this year, British-based tech firm QuantuMDx developed a new, low-cost diagnostic DNA analyzer the size of a smartphone which is being billed as a \u201chandheld lab\u201d. The device \u2013 called Q-Poc \u2013 can accurately diagnose everything from cancers to infectious diseases in minutes. Although it is currently in alpha testing stage, the company hopes to get the product in the hands of doctors by early 2018.\nQ-Poc runs on a solar-powered battery and it\u2019s designed to read biological samples submitted via a credit card-size cartridge. It can work with a range of sample types: swabs can be used to detect sexually-transmitted infections, while saliva is used to detect tuberculosis. (Tests for other diseases will be added at a later date.) The device uses mobile technology, enabling the test results to be geo-stamped and shared in real time.\nThe prospect of a speedy diagnosis at a patient\u2019s side is exciting, particularly in countries where access to medical care is a challenge. Subject to regulatory approval by the World Health Organization (WHO), QuantuMDx hopes to initially roll out the Q-Poc unit in South Africa, before expanding to other markets.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Even if the spoons aren\u2019t eaten, once used, they can decompose in a few days. Photograph: Bakeys\nIt was a big year for edible everyday items, like cutlery and beer cans. First up, an Indian cutlery company, Bakeys, invented cutlery that you can eat as a way to tackle plastic waste in oceans and landfill. (Welcome to a new geological epoch of trash \u2013 scientists are calling it the manmade Anthropocene.)\nPlastic cutlery significantly contributes to this problem \u2013 estimates suggest the US alone uses 40bn plastic utensils a year. Hence the need for edible versions. Bakeys makes vegan-friendly cutlery from rice, wheat and an ancient grain called sorghum, which was picked because it doesn\u2019t go soggy when immersed in liquid.\nThe cutlery comes in three flavors: savory (salt and cumin); sweet (sugar); and plain. And, if you\u2019re wondering \u2013 it kind of tastes like a dry cracker.\nWhy not wash down the cutlery with an edible beer holder? Americans are consuming more beer it seems \u2013 67bn beer cans each year, apparently. According to the Brewers Association, this number is expected to grow significantly as craft breweries get more popular.\nThe problem is that plastic beer can holders pose a threat to fish and marine wildlife when they end up in the ocean. Saltwater Brewery, based in Florida, has come up with a solution: biodegradable, edible beer pack rings made from wheat and barley waste. The rings disintegrate within two hours of being in the ocean, which prevents fish or other sea animals getting stuck. They\u2019re also harmless if ingested by curious fish.\nMore than 50 craft breweries have already contacted Saltwater expressing an interest in using the edible rings. The brewery is now developing metal molds capable of making 400,000 rings per month and hopes to build a centralized production facility by 2017.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) hope to bombard a ferret habitat in Montana with a vaccine administered via specially designed drones. Photograph: Will Singleton/AP\nOne of 2016\u2019s most heartwarming stories revolved around a cunning plan by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to bombard a ferret habitat in Montana with a vaccine administered via specially designed drones that can \u201cshoot\u201d pellets in three directions at the same time.\nAll this in a bid to save the endangered black-footed ferret. The vaccine pellets are actually intended for the prairie dog population inside the habitat at the UL Bend National Wildlife Refuge. The ferrets are dependent upon prairie dogs for food and shelter, but a flea-borne disease called sylvatic plague has slowly been killing the prairie dogs off.\nThe FWS came up with a \u201cglorified gumball machine\u201d to spit out the vaccine pellets. The machine which can be attached to a drone which uses GPS to drop the pellets throughout the habitat. Oh, and if you\u2019re wondering: the FWS said lab tests show that prairie dogs find the bait in the vaccines \u201cdelicious\u201d.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A report by a leading markets analyst predicted the 3D printing materials market would grow by nearly 266% over the next five years. Photograph: Alamy\nAs we\u2019ve established, humans produce a lot of trash \u2013 apparently of the more than 300m tons of plastic produced globally every year, one refuse truck\u2019s worth ends up in our waters, landfills and streets every minute.\nOne of our favorite stories this year came from India, where a local entrepreneur has set up a production facility at a local rubbish dump, where waste pickers convert high-density polyethylene (HPDE) \u2013 mostly used for plastic bottles \u2013 into 3D printing filament to eventually be sold to 3D printing companies.\nThe market for 3D printing filament \u2013 the majority of which is made from virgin plastic \u2013 is growing rapidly. A recent report predicted the 3D printing materials market will grow by nearly 266% in the next five years.\nAnd, while the market for ethical filament is still relatively small, the greatest potential 3D printing seems to be offering the developing world is employment \u2013 there are an estimated 15 million people globally who currently make their living from waste picking, for example.", "lang": "en", "date_time": "2017-01-01T23:00:08", "intro": "From edible cutlery to drone vaccines, we celebrate the technologies and innovations that promise to advance sustainability efforts in the years ahead", "topic": "Guardian sustainable business|Donald Trump|Nasa|Climate change|features", "author": "Laura Parker", "source": "guardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/01/sustainable-technology-2016-climate-change-environment", "category": ""},
{"title": "Texas looks set to follow North Carolina with push for 'bathroom bill'", "content": "Lieutenant governor Dan Patrick is proposing what critics see as an attack on transgender people and business leaders call unnecessary and unenforceable\nThe passage of a \u201cbathroom bill\u201d last March sparked a maelstrom with severe political, economic and cultural consequences for North Carolina that continued through the end of 2016. Yet Texas is poised to propose a similar law in 2017.\nTexas federal judge halts Obama protection of transgender health rights Read more\nIn November, one of the state\u2019s most senior politicians published his top 10 priorities for the next legislative session. A \u201cWomen\u2019s Privacy Act\u201d was at number six, right after banning immigration \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and insisting on photo ID at the ballot box.\nThe act, said lieutenant governor Dan Patrick, is necessary so that \u201cwomen and girls\u201d can have \u201cprivacy and safety in their restrooms, showers and locker rooms\u201d.\nWhen filed, the bill is likely to turn national attention to Texas in the wake of North Carolina legislators\u2019 failure to repeal their bill during a special session on 21 December. Patrick issued a statement the following day congratulating them.\nThe so-called bathroom bill in North Carolina includes a provision that requires people to use public bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate. Critics have described it as a thinly veiled attack on the transgender community under the guise of protecting public safety.\nPatrick hasn\u2019t released his own proposed bill, but has said it would allow businesses to create their own bathroom policies.\nDespite the demonstrable negative consequences in states that have passed laws that undermine LGBTQ equality, the coming months will indicate whether the ascent of Donald Trump to the White House is emboldening religious conservatives to press for more such bills after a series of gains for gay and transgender people at the federal level under the Obama administration.\nA federal court ruling Saturday may further embolden these efforts. A Texas judge temporarily halted Obama administration rules that are intended to ban discrimination by doctors and hospitals against transgender persons. Joining Texas in the suit were Wisconsin, Kentucky, Nebraska and Kansas.\nIn August, the same judge sided with 13 Republican-controlled states to block transgender protections in public schools sought by the Obama administration.\n\u2018Something that should be avoided\u2019\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters rally against HB2 in Raleigh, North Carolina in April. Photograph: Chuck Liddy/AP\nSo-called \u201creligious freedom\u201d provisions similar to those that caused controversy in Indiana in 2015 are also set to be aired in the Texas statehouse next year.\n\u201cI certainly believe that logically thinking people would look to North Carolina and look to Indiana,\u201d said Chuck Smith, chief executive of Equality Texas, an LGBTQ advocacy group.\nNorth Carolina 'bathroom bill' blocking LGBT protections unlikely to see repeal Read more\nSuch people would see, he said, \u201cthe economic consequences that were experienced in those states as a result of filing discriminatory legislation, and a logically thinking person would come to the conclusion that that is something that should be avoided in the state of Texas.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s chamber of commerce, the Texas Association of Business (TAB), reached that view. It has produced a 23-page report warning of dire economic consequences if the state follows North Carolina\u2019s path by pursuing a policy that would harm tourism, alienate employers and dissuade talented millennials from staying in or moving to Texas.\n\u201cIf you just look at North Carolina and Indiana and put that over a Texas-sized footprint of our economy, it could be up to $8.5bn and 185,000 jobs lost, it is very dramatic,\u201d said Chris Wallace, the association\u2019s president.\n\u201cWe want to remain one of the top states in which to do business, so why would we want to do anything to risk any of that, by legislation that\u2019s really unnecessary and unenforceable?\n\u201cThe question of how you would enforce people going into the right bathroom\u2026What, so you have to take your birth certificate? It gets really tricky.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got too many core issues that we need to be worried about in this state \u2013 education, transportation, water, many more. Economic development, keeping us strong. We don\u2019t need these types of issues to overshadow our core agenda items.\u201d\nAtt a Texas Tribune event in November, Joe Straus, the speaker of the Texas house of representatives, said he had other, more urgent concerns than the bathroom bill.\nPatrick, though, appears unmoved. In a statement earlier this month his office called the TAB report \u201cmisinformation and fear-mongering regarding a bill they haven\u2019t even seen\u201d. It also defended the proposal as a way to \u201cassure that sexual predators, like those who exploit the internet, will not be able to freely enter women\u2019s restrooms, locker rooms or showers, and that businesses are not forced by local ordinances to allow men in women\u2019s restrooms and locker rooms\u201d.\nPatrick\u2019s spokesperson did not return a Guardian request for comment.\n\u2018We have a friend in the White House\u2019\nSexual assault in any location is, of course, already illegal, while there is no evidence that non-discrimination laws have resulted in increased rates of sexual assault. By contrast, LGBTQ advocates argue that violence and bias against transgender people is a very real problem exacerbated by prejudicial laws.\nNorth Carolina\u2019s HB2 was signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican who lost his bid for re-election in November. The backlash saw sports events and concerts cancelled and businesses scrapping investment plans.\nPatrick, 66, was a radio talkshow host perhaps best-known for getting an on-air vasectomy until he was elected as lieutenant governor in 2014 on a platform of stopping the \u201cinvasion\u201d of undocumented immigrants. He was the Texas state chairman for the Trump presidential campaign.\n\u201cStarting in 2017, we will have a friend in the White House who was clearly elected because the people of this country believe in the conservative principles that have guided the way we govern in Texas,\u201d Patrick said in November.\nSmith, of Equality Texas, said that Texas\u2019s conservative politicians telegraphed their intentions to introduce more anti-equality legislation long before Trump\u2019s victory.\n\u201cI believe we have seen a heightened sense of concern about the possibility of favourable policies being rolled back on a federal level,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the state level we already saw the threats that were lying ahead and those haven\u2019t really changed.\u201d\nThe US supreme court legalised same-sex marriage nationwide in June 2015. That major victory for gay rights appears to have inspired a pushback by conservative Republicans in states.\nMexico's gay couples fight backlash against same-sex marriage Read more\nAccording to the Human Rights Campaign, more than 200 \u201canti-LGBTQ bills\u201d were introduced across the country in 2016 sessions \u2013 most failing to pass \u2013 and more than 111 million people live in states without clear state-level protections against LGBTQ workplace discrimination.\nSmith is also concerned that 2017 will see Texas legislators press for \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws that would, for example, exempt Christian retailers who believe homosexuality is a sin from providing services for gay weddings.\nSo far there are a handful of Texas bills which advocates consider anti-LGBTQ that have been filed amid the usual slew of pro-gun, pro-God, anti-undocumented immigrant, anti-abortion and anti-federal government proposals up for discussion when the legislative session starts in January.\nOne would eliminate local non-discrimination ordinances if they have protections that go beyond state law \u2013 reminiscent of HB2. Another calls on the state not to enforce federal laws that the Texas legislature deems to violate the state constitution \u2013 which since 2005 has defined marriage as between a man and a woman.\nA high-profile revision of the law on a parent\u2019s right to know information about their child has raised fears that it could force teachers to out students.", "lang": "en", "date_time": "2017-01-01T12:00:00", "intro": "Lieutenant governor Dan Patrick is proposing what critics see as an attack on transgender people and business leaders call unnecessary and unenforceable", "topic": "Texas|LGBT rights|news", "author": "Tom Dart", "source": "guardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/01/texas-bathroom-bill-lgbt", "category": ""},

{"title": "Medical smart jacket tackles misdiagnosis of pneumonia", "content": "Jacket would distinguish pneumonia\u2019s symptoms up to four times faster than a doctor, in battle against illness that kills half a million children under five in sub-Saharan Africa every year\nUgandan graduate Brian Turyabagye was studying engineering when his friend\u2019s grandmother fell seriously ill. Accompanying her to hospital, he watched as doctors diagnosed malaria and prescribing various treatments accordingly. Only as she lay dying did they realise their initial diagnosis was wrong. It was pneumonia that was killing her.\nTuryabagye, 24, was so shocked by the circumstances surrounding the death that he began researching methodologies for diagnosing pneumonia and its treatments. To his surprise, he discovered that the illness affects far more children than it does adults. According to Unicef, pneumonia kills half a million children under five in sub-Saharan Africa every year, with the region accounting for half of all global deaths from pneumonia of children under five.\n\u201cMany of those deaths are because of misdiagnosis,\u201d says Turyabagye. \u201cIn the villages and remote areas, children get sick \u2013 and the first reaction is to treat them for malaria. Most people are aware of malaria, and the signs for malaria and pneumonia are very similar, so it is difficult for health professionals to differentiate.\u201d\nEven when a correct diagnosis is made, treatment is often unavailable. According to the Uganda Paediatrics Association, fewer than 20% of children with pneumonia receive antibiotics, which cost less than $1 (81p).\nSo Turyabagye began designing a biomedical smart jacket that would distinguish pneumonia\u2019s symptoms \u2013 temperature, breathing rate and sound of the lungs \u2013 and eliminate most human error, diagnosing pneumonia at a rate three to four times faster than a doctor.\nHe named it \u201cMamaope\u201d, or \u201cmother\u2019s hope\u201d \u2013 a reference to the 27,000 children who die of pneumonia in Uganda every year.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Android app that accompanies the Mamaope jacket.\n\u201cWe focused on the distinguishing signs of pneumonia,\u201d says Turyabagye. \u201cOne of the processes that most doctors use is a stethoscope to the check the lungs. But [pneumonia] tends to be on side points around the body, not just in the chest or back.

{"title": "Israelis now face a fateful choice as hope for a two-state solution fades", "content": "Early in his major foreign policy speech last Wednesday about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, US secretary of state John Kerry promised to tell some \u201cuncomfortable truths\u201d. He certainly did that. But here\u2019s the key question: for jaded Israelis almost defiantly committed to political stagnation, will it matter?\nKerry started on well-worn paths: Israel cannot remain Jewish and democratic without reaching a two-state solution and the window is closing; the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, cannot claim to support two states and continue expanding settlements; the Palestinian leadership poisons peace by glorifying violence. America under Obama was overwhelmingly committed to Israeli military and security needs and it allowed the UN security council resolution 2334, condemning settlements, for Israel\u2019s own good. Lastly, he reiterated the long-standing core principles of the two state solution.\nFor an Israeli audience\u2013 and the speech felt squarely aimed at them \u2013 those themes aren\u2019t new. In fact, they are axiomatic and, increasingly, transparent. Israelis appear to have put up a psychological separation barrier: the world warns that the conflict will ruin their lives, but, day to day, they feel that things are going fine. In this narrative, outsiders criticise Israeli policy because \u201cthe world\u201d is out to get Israel. Netanyahu is in perfect symbiosis with this approach. He has long positioned himself as the man who speaks Israel\u2019s truth to global power. He has been elected four times: his strategy works. Perhaps Kerry\u2019s speech can\u2019t dent such armour.\nBut there were other uncomfortable truths in the speech, less commonly heard by Israelis.\nFirst, Kerry displayed surprising knowledge of what occupation means on the ground. In rare detail, he noted that no Palestinian can get a permit to build in Area C (60% of the West Bank); that over the last two years Israel has destroyed structures, leaving 1,300 people homeless, as settlements grow, outside the large blocs and east of the wall. He told about business people who can\u2019t move their goods, Palestinian roads that can\u2019t connect, children in Gaza playing in rubble.He observed that Israel\u2019s settlements in the Jordan Valley and other calculated locations are chopping any Palestinian state into pieces. If Israelis even know these facts \u2013 not a given \u2013 they have implicitly presumed that outsiders don\u2019t. Or that they won\u2019t do anything about it.\nA second unusual point was Kerry\u2019s explanation of why all settlement expansion, including in large blocs adjacent to Israel, is bad for peace: these are unilateral moves. It was a not-so-subtle jab at Netanyahu\u2019s mantra accusing the Palestinians of unilateral action in international forums, one of the latters\u2019 justifications for rejecting peace talks. In another striking moment, Kerry began to sketch out the dystopian spectre of endless occupation: \u201cIf the occupation becomes permanent, [the Palestinian Authority] could dissolve and turn over all administrative and security responsibilities to the Israelis\u2026 who would administer the schools and hospitals? Does Israel want to pay for the billions of dollars of lost international assistance?\u201d\nWith these hard and less hackneyed truths, Kerry may have cracked the brittle shell of some of Netanyahu\u2019s own axioms. For example, Netanyahu conveys to Israelis that conflict management is sustainable because he can hold off global pressure and sell good-image stories about Israel. Kerry\u2019s speech showed that outsiders look past the screen and see the occupation clearly. Netanyahu has argued that Israel need not negotiate if the Palestinians take unfair unilateral action; Kerry exposed the fact that Israel\u2019s \u201cstatus quo\u201d is just as much unilateral action. While Netanyahu lulls his public with the implicit notion that the two-state solution will wait until Israel deems the conditions ripe, Kerry illustrated that in reality it is almost already gone.\nObama and Kerry will be gone first, of course. For the next few weeks, Israelis can tell themselves that President-elect Trump will be a better friend; that Theresa May distanced herself from Kerry\u2019s speech and may want to co-operate with Trump on Israel, making a strong triangular alliance. But remember that resolution 2334 passed with the UK\u2019s \u201cyea\u201d \u2013 a stronger statement than the US abstention. And the new chums Netanyahu has been cultivating \u2013 China and Russiato show the West his independence, \u2013 abandoned Israel in the vote as well.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Israelis may eventually have to ask themselves if Netanyahu is telling the truth.\u2019 Photograph: Gali Tibbon/AFP/Getty Images\nIsraelis may eventually have to ask themselves if Netanyahu is telling the truth \u2013 about any of it. The speech may cause Israelis to inch towards the conclusion that he\u2019s not and that his so-called stagnation on conflict resolution is making the two-state solution all but obsolete. At that point, as tepid as they were about two states, Israelis will confront a menu of options that are less familiar, some of them far less appealing. What are they?\nOne is the scenario Kerry described. It is the logical extension of political stasis, combined with the continuing creep of the Israel Defence Forces and settlements in the West Bank and a locked-down, festering Gaza. The developments are easily visualised: the PA collapses in strife or rebellion and the Israeli army ends up governing. A war breaks out in Gaza; this time, Israel could follow through on threats made in the 2014 war to reoccupy the Strip, which sounded like outlying extemist voices then. For anyone who remembers the pre-Oslo years when Israeli soldiers patrolled the muddy streets of Gazalike target practice for Molotov cocktails, this is a disaster.\nThe next option is the rosy, rightwing panacea for all things of late: annexation of the West Bank, what the right calls Judea and Samaria. Once, this was not said in polite company; today, Israel\u2019s education minister and deputy foreign minister call proudly for Israeli sovereignty in part or all of the territory. How they think fortress-like, exclusive settlements of Jewish Israelis will harmoniously co-exist with dismembered Palestinian communities living under bastardised autonomy with no incentive for co-operation with Israel is unclear. The ensuing anger will inevitably be met with matching levels of violence. One equal, democratic binational or civic-identity state is sometimes mentioned as an option; it is a non-starter. Large majorities on both sides reject it in polls. Israel will never give full voting rights to a population similar in size to the Jewish public.\nThe last feasible option is a mix of separation and integration. This refers to federation or confederation \u2013 see the Cyprus peace plans (not yet realised), post-war Bosnia or even the EU. The separation element acknowledges two national groups with defined territories. \u201cIntegration\u201d is more of an acknowledgement that borders must be made porous to relax the suffocation of Palestinian movement and livelihood; that natural resources in a tiny land require joint management; that neighbourhoods and economies are so intertwined that surgical separation could kill the patient.\nFor a long time, Israelis wanted to agree with Netanyahu and believed that represssing the problem would make it go away. One speech won\u2019t change that overnight, but it may be a clarifying moment that certain truths can only be ignored for so long. Then, one of the options on the menu will happen either way.\nDahlia Scheindlin is a political consultant based in Tel Aviv.

Now files have revealed why the state was so reluctant to intervene\n\u2018It would be bad for our interests\u2019: why Thatcher ignored the murder of an Observer journalist\nThe execution of the Observer journalist Farzad Bazoft on 15 March 1990, ordered by Saddam Hussein, provoked outrage around the world. Yet later that same day Margaret Thatcher and her government decided not to take any action, against what ministers admitted was a \u201cruthless\u201d regime, for fear of jeopardising lucrative exports to Iraq.\nIn memos written two years after Saddam used mustard gas to slaughter more than 3,000 Kurds and only months before he marched into Kuwait, sparking war, newly released cabinet documents reveal that trade was still the uppermost concern for ministers.\nEven as the news of the hanging of the 31-year-old reporter was coming in, and despite public promises of firm action against what was clearly an increasingly dangerous dictator, cabinet ministers decided not to impose any sanctions.\nTrade or credit restrictions on Iraq would be \u201cineffective in influencing the attitude of the Iraqi government\u201d and would inflict \u201cdisproportionate damage on UK industry\u201d, Norman Lamont, a future chancellor but at that time the chief secretary to the Treasury, noted in a memo to foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, the files disclose.\n\u201cOpinion here has been deeply shocked by Iraq\u2019s behaviour,\u201d Hurd conceded in reply, before making clear he shared Lamont\u2019s concerns. \u201cWe have a considerable commercial presence to protect in Iraq,\u201d he wrote.\nLamont, now Lord Lamont of Lerwick, told the Observer that he had little memory of events from 27 years ago and thought it unlikely he would have had much input into any action taken by Britain against Saddam\u2019s government.\n\u201cI have no recollection of being involved in this sad story, although I remember vividly being shocked by the tragic death of the young man,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was some argument about how British was he \u2013 he did have an Iranian passport and that was the decisive thing: he wasn\u2019t a British citizen.\u201d\nBazoft, an Iranian-born freelance reporter who held British residency, had been invited by Saddam\u2019s government to visit Iraq with other journalists on a group trip to report on elections planned for the country\u2019s Kurdish areas. It was his sixth visit to the country and he was keen to get a story that the Observer could use. The day he left, in September 1989, the Independent published a report about an explosion in August at the al-Hillah military complex south of Baghdad, suspected of modifying ballistic missiles and secretly manufacturing chemical weapons. There were rumours of hundreds of deaths. Bazoft asked a British nurse, Daphne Parish, to drive him out there: he took photographs and collected soil samples.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protests outside the Iraqi embassy in London in 1990 after the announcement of Bazoft\u2019s death. Photograph: Bill Cross/Daily Mail / Rex\nHe was arrested at Baghdad airport while waiting for his flight back to London. He was incarcerated at Abu Ghraib prison where he was kept in solitary confinement, starved and beaten. On 1 November he was placed in front of television cameras and confessed to being an Israeli agent.\nIn 2003, the Observer tracked down Kadem Askar, the colonel in the Iraqi intelligence service who interrogated Bazoft. He admitted that he knew Bazoft was innocent, but that he was powerless to obstruct Saddam\u2019s personal orders to have him convicted and executed.\nWithin months of Bazoft\u2019s death \u2013 his body was unceremoniously returned to his parents in the UK, turning up at Heathrow unannounced in a rough box \u2013 Saddam had sent his troops over the British-drawn border between Iraq and Kuwait in the invasion that sparked the Gulf war of 1990-91.\nThe files from March 1990 were released as part of an initiative to gradually reduce the embargo on official government files from 30 years to 20, and are among Cabinet Office papers from 1989 and 1990 that are now available to the public at the National Archives in Kew, west London.\nThey reveal that Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s foreign affairs adviser, told the prime minister that there was little doubt there would be calls to suspend credit or impose trade restrictions on Saddam\u2019s Iraq. He added: \u201cBut we would not get international support for this and it would not actually achieve anything.\u201d Lamont agreed.\nFive days after Bazoft was hanged, Hurd warned: \u201cIn the atmosphere brought about by our present difficulties, Iraq would see any action against credit as a further political response to Bazoft and would hit back hard. That would be bad for our wider commercial interests where our competitors would happily step in to take up our share of the market.\u201d\nThe only action the Thatcher government took was not to subsidise a planned Birmingham trade mission to Iraq and avoid giving publicity to it, the hitherto classified documents show.\nDuring Bazoft and Parish\u2019s six-month imprisonment, smear stories and allegations against him appeared in several newspapers. Saddam said the two were British or Israeli spies. There has never been any evidence to support the allegation and, indeed, records uncovered in Baghdad in 2003 showed Saddam was well aware of this and simply wanted a \u201cpunishment for Margaret Thatcher\u201d and to humiliate Britain. A one-day trial of the two was held in secret \u2013 in Arabic, which neither defendant understood \u2013 and without any defence.\nParish was sentenced to 15 years in jail. Ten months after Bazoft\u2019s death, she was allowed to return to the UK.\nTwo backbench Tory MPs at the time repeated the notion that Bazoft was a spy, something picked up by newspapers, and there had long been suspicion that another story, revealing Bazoft had acquired a criminal record as a young man, had been leaked to discredit him.\nCertainly the government was aware of his past. The files at Kew contain a note sent by Sara Dent, private secretary to David Waddington, then home secretary, to Powell before Bazoft\u2019s execution. \u201cYou might wish to know,\u201d she said, \u201cthat from our inquiries on his immigration files, Mr Bazoft, the Observer journalist who has been sentenced to death for spying in Iraq, has a criminal record in this country.\u201d\nDent added: \u201cAlthough this has no bearing on his sentence in Iraq, it may be raised by the Iraqis or by the press.\u201d\nShe noted that Bazoft had arrived in 1975 as a student. Four years later, he was in financial difficulties and his application for an extension to his stay was refused. He went into a building society, threatened to blow it up and demanded money from a cashier. He obtained \u00a3475 \u2013 the amount he was in debt \u2013 and was arrested later that day. There was no bomb but he was sentenced to 18 months in prison.\nHis deportation order was revoked after evidence emerged that Iran had issued a warrant for his arrest as an \u201canti-revolutionary\u201d. His family were critics of Ayatollah Khomeini and he had been allowed to stay in the UK on an \u201cexceptional basis\u201d, Dent wrote.\nShe ended her note to Powell by saying that the Home Office \u201cproposed not to volunteer this information but not deny it if it is raised with us\u201d.\nTabloid newspapers gave prominent front-page coverage to Bazoft\u2019s previous criminal conviction, while MPs Rupert Allason and Terry Dicks slated his character. Lord (Woodrow) Wyatt told his News of the World readers that Britain should \u201cstart maximising trade and stop talking about Farzad Bazoft\u201d.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Saddam Hussein with his sons Uday (left) and Qusay. Photograph: Faleh Kheiber/Reuters\nDonald Trelford, then editor of the Observer, described the coverage of Bazoft\u2019s imprisonment and execution by some editors on Fleet Street as \u201cpersistently hostile\u201d. He said that, even 20 years on, it remained hard to \u201ccontain one\u2019s anger \u2013 not just at the insane barbarity of Saddam, but at some Tory MPs and the parts of the British press that tried to pin the blame for his murder on poor Farzad himself\u201d.\nThat the government of the day had consistently turned a blind eye to atrocities committed by Saddam became clear at the Scott arms-to-Iraq inquiry set up by John Major after the collapse of a trial of the directors of a Coventry-based machine tools firm, Matrix Churchill. It emerged during the trial that the directors were encouraged by MI5 and MI6 to spy on Saddam\u2019s weapons programme when they visited Iraqi factories.\nChemical weapons were known to have been used by Saddam during the Iran-Iraq war and, in March 1988, Iraqi warplanes attacked the Kurdish town of Halabja with chemical weapons, gassing between 3,000 and 5,000 men, women and children. At that time, the government had decided to relax controls on arms exports to Iraq.\nThe files, released last week, include a document from 1989 in which the private secretary of the former Tory chancellor and foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe, notes that Tariq Aziz, Saddam\u2019s foreign minister, had promised that Iraq would not use chemical weapons in future. At the time ministers were planning to increase export credit guarantees for Iraq in the hope that British companies would win further contracts.\nLater that year, Hurd told Thatcher: \u201cThe Iraqi regime is ruthless and disagreeable but its influence is growing following the Iran/Iraq conflict [which ended in 1988].\u201d He warned of the dangers of taking measures that would damage \u201cBritish business\u201d.\nAlso in the National Archives is a copy of a letter Thatcher sent to Saddam after the decision to release Parish. Dated 16 July 1990, it reads: \u201cI was very pleased to hear of your Excellency\u2019s decision to release Mrs Daphne Parish on humanitarian grounds \u2026 We have long-standing ties and there are many positive aspects to our relations on which we can build.\u201d\nA plaque and photograph remembering Farzad Bazoft remain in place in the Observer newsroom\nIraq and Britain: a short history\n1941 Iraq is reoccupied by Britain, less than a decade after gaining independence from British mandate.\n1975 Iranian-born Farzad Bazoft, aged 16, comes to live in the UK with his parents.\n1979 Saddam Hussein, of Iraq\u2019s Arab nationalist Ba\u2019ath party, becomes leader.\n1980 Iran-Iraq war begins, ending in stalemate eight years later.\n1981 Israeli air raid destroys nuclear reactor near Baghdad.\n1988 Saddam attacks Kurdish town with poison gas.

But when he returned to Lebanon two years after his first trip, he found the subjects of his portraits \u2013 now his friends \u2013 still in dire straits. This is what happened next\nIt\u2019s my last day with Khouloud and Jamal and I\u2019m struggling with a decision. Whenever possible I like to take a print back to give to those I\u2019ve documented, and in my bag I have a photograph I took of the couple two years before. But should I give it to them?\nIn the picture Khouloud, paralysed from the neck down, lies in the tent she shares with her family in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa valley. Jamal sits at the end of her bed, holding her hand, the couple looking at each other with a love that is at odds with the stark, grainy black-and-white image that reflects the truth of their desperate situation.\nIf there is one image that betrays my belief in the power of photography to create change, it\u2019s this one. For here we are, two years later, sitting in that same dark oppressive tent and nothing has changed. Naively perhaps, I\u2019d believed that telling Khouloud\u2019s story would have made a difference, and I can\u2019t help feeling I failed them.\nFinally, I reach down and take the photograph out of my bag.\nAs I hand it to them I say: \u201cWhen I took this two years ago, I didn\u2019t take a photograph of a refugee, I didn\u2019t take a photograph of a disabled woman; instead I took a photograph of a couple who are deeply in love, and that\u2019s what this will always mean to me.\u201d\nIn 2014 I went to Lebanon with Handicap International to document some of Syria\u2019s most vulnerable refugees. The sick, the elderly, single-parent families and those living with disabilities. People like 38-year-old Reem. She was in bed at home in Idlib, Syria, when a rocket hit her house. Her husband was killed next to her, one of her children also died, and Reem lost a leg. When I met her she was living in a tent on the top floor of an unfinished building. She was still learning to use her prosthesis and was unable to use the stairs, leaving her trapped. She didn\u2019t want her surviving children to live with her \u2013 she felt ashamed because she believed her disability meant she couldn\u2019t be a mother to them.\nOnly her father, Abdel, lived with her on the rooftop. As I was taking his photograph, Abdel kept looking to the side, his eyes focused on the distant snow-capped mountains. I asked why he kept looking that way.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tripoli, Lebanon, 2016: \u2018Aya hugs her father, Ayman. The family had moved from a tent in Idlib to this rented room, but life was still a constant struggle.\u2019 Photograph: Giles Duley/UNHCR\n\u201cThose mountains,\u201d he replied, \u201care my home. I am an old man and may never return home, but at least each morning it\u2019s the first thing I see, and when I go to bed the last.\u201d\nOver the following weeks I met dozens of Syrians like Reem, fighting for survival and dignity as refugees in Lebanon. In 2014 the situation was already desperate, with over a million Syrians sheltering in a county of just four million. The infrastructure was close to collapse.\nRecovering from a life-changing accident myself (in 2011 I was injured while working in Afghanistan), that trip to Lebanon and the people I met were to have a profound effect both on my life and my work. But it was in meeting Khouloud \u2013 and, later, a girl called Aya \u2013 that I would find true inspiration and a renewed purpose for my photography\nIn 2013 Khouloud, 32, was working in her garden with her children when a sniper shot her through the spine. She collapsed, paralysed from the neck down. \u201cI tried to plant a small area of land near our house as it wasn\u2019t possible to get vegetables like before,\u201d she said. \u201cI was taking care of the plants with my four children and suddenly a bullet hit my neck and I fell down and lost sensation. I could not move any more.\u201d\nAfter her initial treatment her family managed to get her out of Syria. Eventually they found themselves living in an informal tented settlement in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa valley, one of thousands of unofficial camps dotted across the country. When we met she\u2019d been there for five months.\nThe UNHCR was providing food coupons but the family was struggling. Her husband has to provide Khouloud with 24-hour care. I asked her: \u201cWhat\u2019s your hope for the future?\u201d \u201cTo be a mother again,\u201d she replied. \u201cI wish I could move my fingers because sometimes my son is injured outside and he comes in next to me. He moves my hand and he puts my fingers on to the wound. I wish I could move my fingers to touch him and make him feel like I am feeling the wound with him.\u201d\nWhat struck me was the love within that family. Despite everything they had been through and the incredible suffering they still endured, there was laughter, hope and affection. They treated me like a family member. Despite having so little, they cooked and shared what they had.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lebanon, 2014: \u2018This is Khouloud and Jamal in the photograph I took in their tent in Bekaa valley, Lebanon, when I first met them.\u2019 Photograph: Giles Duley/Handicap International\nWhen I met Aya she was sitting alone on a concrete floor in a dark, damp tent. She has spina bifida, which means she is paralysed from the waist down and the curvature in her spin makes it hard to sit upright unaided. She was four years old. Seeing her there, I thought I couldn\u2019t take her photograph. She seemed so vulnerable, and that goes against the way I like to work. Yet Aya was to prove me wrong. She turned out to be the feistiest four-year-old I\u2019d ever met.\nI spent the day with her family, and her mother, Sihan, told me about Aya\u2019s relationship with her sister, Iman. The two were inseparable. When their house in Idlib was bombed, it was Iman, only 10 herself, who held Aya in the basement where they sheltered for three days. With no food or water, she never let her sister go. Then, on the perilous journey from Syria to Lebanon, which took them several weeks, it was Iman who carried Aya.\nIman walked into the tent while we were talking, and I expected to see that tenderness. Instead, Aya looked up at her sister and exclaimed \u201cPick me up, Donkey!\u201d\nOver the coming weeks I revisited them and \u2013 as with Khouloud and her family \u2013 witnessed the strength of their love and unity. One of the hardest things was listening to Aya\u2019s father, Ayman, talking about the possibility of splitting his family up. Things were so desperate: living in a makeshift tent, the children often sick, he not allowed to work because of his refugee status, the family sinking further and further into debt, and Aya not getting the medical support she desperately needed. The other children weren\u2019t attending school and Ayman was considering sending them to live with others.\nTheir most immediate concern was whether Aya would survive the winter. On my last day there, as the family attempted to winter-proof their tent with materials supplied by the UNHCR, Sihan was in tears as she told me that she doubted Aya could survive these hardships. But Aya had other thoughts. She interrupted her mother to exclaim with typical defiance: \u201cAya doesn\u2019t die!\u201d\nIn the end I did take a photograph of Aya. It was of her playing hopscotch with Iman. She is laughing, and in that moment you see her strength and passion for life.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Laval, France, 2016: \u2018Aya with her mother, Sihan, in France. For the first time in years, Sihan was able to tell Aya: \u201cIt\u2019s OK, this is your home now.\u201d\u2019 Photograph: Giles Duley /UNHCR\nAfter returning home I often thought of the families I\u2019d met. Some I managed to stay in contact with. Others, I had no idea of their fate. Then, in 2015, the UNHCR commissioned me to document the refugee crisis across Europe and the Middle East. Its brief was simple: \u201cFollow your heart.\u201d\nThe project began in Lesbos, documenting scenes we are all too familiar with. I followed the refugees\u2019 journey to Berlin, criss-crossing Europe, trying to record stories. However, I knew that if I was to fully fulfil my brief and follow my heart, I\u2019d have to return to Lebanon.\nSo in February 2016 I went back.\nI visited Aya and her family. They had moved out of the tent and, thanks to assistance from the UNHCR, were now living in a rented room on the outskirts of Tripoli. It wasn\u2019t much, but at least it provided proper shelter, and the children seemed much healthier.\nAya was her normal feisty self and had grown up so much. Her new hobby was painting her nails and trying out hairstyles. I photographed her being pushed around in her wheelchair by her brothers, screaming \u201cFaster! Faster!\u201d I have some understanding of the pain that she is in each day and her struggles with disability \u2013 yet I have never heard her complain.\nLife was still hard. What support the family received barely covered rent and food. While the kids could attend school, often they missed classes because the family could not pay the bus fare. Ayman still wasn\u2019t allowed to work.\nMany days were spent sitting around the house. The family, like most refugees, were stuck in limbo.\nWhen I first met Aya\u2019s family they talked of returning to Syria as soon as possible. After over five years of war, they were now questioning if they could ever return. And even if they did, what would be left? The schools, hospitals and businesses lie in ruins; their own house is destroyed. What future would they have?\nWith the prospects of a return to Syria dwindling and life in Lebanon impossible, their hope now was for resettlement. \u201cI never wanted to go to Europe, so far from Syria,\u201d Ayman said, \u201cbut if this gives my children a chance of a future, then I will go.\u201d\nThey had been put forward by the UNHCR for resettlement in France, but months had passed and still no news. They were losing hope.\nI also returned to see Reem. I was happy to see she was now able to negotiate the stairs, and her daughter, Sarah, was living with her again. That evening I sat with the family (Reem\u2019s two brothers had joined her, living on the roof-top), drinking coffee and eating homemade bread from the open fire. In so many ways, life was normal. The family joked and laughed, reminisced about life back in Syria, discussed food and football. But for the refugees living in Lebanon, nothing is normal. Like Aya\u2019s family they were stuck, unable to build new lives or plan futures.\nI managed to track down most of those I\u2019d met on my first visit, but in the chaos it was hard to trace everyone. On my last day I got a phone call. It was Khouloud\u2019s family. She\u2019d heard I was back and wanted me to visit. When I asked where she was living, I was told she was in the same tent I\u2019d seen her in two years before.\nI felt like I\u2019d been punched in the stomach. How could she still be living in that tent? Of all those I\u2019d visited in 2014, Khouloud\u2019s situation had seemed the most desperate. A tetraplegic woman living in a makeshift tent with her husband as full-time carer. I\u2019d told her story and yet nothing had changed. I felt as if I had failed them.\nI extended my stay in Lebanon and went to see them.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bekaa valley, Lebanon, 2016: \u2018Khouloud helps her youngest daughter, also called Aya, with her homework.\u2019 Photograph: Giles Duley/UNHCR\nFor over two years Khouloud had not moved from her bed, staring at the ceiling of the one room that they lived in. Yet still she remained positive; full of laughter and knowing smiles. Jamal still looked at her with, he said, all the love he had when they first met. The children do their homework on the bed with their mother, and they always eat together as a family. Astonishingly, the tent was a place filled with positivity, laughter and kindness.\nOver the days that followed I tried to capture that story through my photographs, I wanted to tell their story again. On the last day I gave them that photograph I\u2019d taken two years before \u2013 with the promise that this time I\u2019d make sure people heard their story.\nJust a few months later, in August 2016, I was in San Francisco, giving a talk. The idea was to raise funds and awareness of the crisis in Lebanon. After the talk I received an email from Philip Schneider, who manages the global community event Gishwhes and is also on the board of a charity called Random Acts. Set up by American actor Misha Collins in 2010, Random Acts has a simple mission statement: \u201cConquer the world, one random act of kindness at a time.\u201d\nKey to its work is a network of connected people who use social media to raise awareness and help individuals and communities. After seeing the photographs and hearing the stories of Aya and Khouloud at the talk, Schneider was so moved that he wanted to combine the Gishwhes and Random Acts networks to see what could be done to help.\nThings moved fast. They set up a crowdfunding page, and the combined online communities started donating and spreading the word. \u201cIn situations like these, it\u2019s hard to know how one can help,\u201d wrote Schneider on their website, \u201cbut Gishwhes and Random Acts have decided that while we may not be able to solve Syria\u2019s problems, making some small impact is better than standing idly by, doing nothing. Therefore, we have narrowed the scope and we are going to radically change the material situation of a few families that have suffered tremendously from this conflict.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Laval, France, 2016: \u2018Aya laughs with her family, days after arriving in France. I realised this was the first time I had seen the family laugh.\u2019 Photograph: Giles Duley/UNHCR\nIn the days and weeks that followed, I sat glued to their fundraiser page. From over 20 countries, hundreds of people donated, often just 10 or 20 dollars. But the impact of so many people coming together to create change was dramatic. Within a month, over $200,000 was raised. Random Acts is now in the process of moving Khouloud and other families in Lebanon into flats, getting them medical treatment and making sure a trust is set up so the children can attend school until they are 18.\nNo matter what your political persuasion, it can\u2019t be denied that, in 2016, compassion, tolerance and empathy took a beating. But this generosity and compassion is inspiring. The issues of the world can seem overwhelming but \u2013 even if just for a few families \u2013 this proves that the kindness of strangers can change lives.\nAround the same time I received further good news: as part of UNHCR\u2019s resettlement scheme, Aya and her family were to start a new life in France. They\u2019d be leaving Lebanon in less than two weeks. Sihan, Aya\u2019s mother, fretted about what they should take. They were allowed a suitcase each, and into those she packed blankets (for she had been told it was cold) and bags of dried thyme, cumin and Arabic coffee (she wanted to carry a taste of home).\nNone of them had flown before. When they boarded the plane in Beirut the family was terrified. Apart from Aya, who, I\u2019m told, did up her seat belt and said \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\nA few days later I visited them at their new home in Laval, an hour\u2019s drive from Paris. Their flat is in a new block on the edge of a small town. It\u2019s quiet, with gardens where the children can play. Random Acts helped provide Aya with a state-of-the-art wheelchair, and for the first time in her life she can fulfil her dream of attending school.\nEating dinner with the family, I realised, that despite knowing them for over two years, it was the first time I\u2019d seen Aya\u2019s parents smile. It was as if a great weight had been lifted from them. As I was leaving, Sihan told me with tears in her eyes, about the first night they slept in their new flat. Aya often struggles to sleep, but on that night, as she put Aya to bed, Sihan was able to whisper to her: \u201cIt\u2019s OK, this is your home now.\u201d", "lang": "en", "date_time": "2017-01-01T10:00:03", "intro": "Giles Duley believes his work can create change.

{"title": "Iraqi forces in Mosul performing 'at their peak', says US commander", "content": "Troops fighting Isis are adjusting well to changes on the ground, says Brig Gen Rick Uribe as he suggests battle could last another three months\nA senior US commander in Iraq on Sunday gave a vote of confidence to Iraqi forces fighting to recapture the northern city of Mosul from Islamic State militants, saying such forces were currently \u201cat their peak\u201d and adjusting well to changing realities on the battlefield.\nSpeaking in an interview, Brig Gen Rick Uribe said he agreed with the forecast given by Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi that it would take another three months to liberate Mosul, the last Iraqi urban center in the hands of the extremist group.\nUS military says Mosul airstrike may have killed civilians at hospital Read more\n\u201cI think that sounds reasonable that we could potentially have a liberated Mosul in about that time period,\u201d Uribe said, dismissing the notion that Iraqi forces were behind schedule.\n\u201cWe are on pretty close to where we want to be,\u201d said Uribe, explaining that military planners knew that while the initial push toward the city would be quick, progress would become \u201csignificantly\u201d slower on the city\u2019s fringes.\nUribe, speaking in Irbil, capital of the self-ruled Kurdish region in northern Iraq, said Iraqi forces north and south of Mosul had made progress since a new offensive was launched last week after a two-week lull in fighting.\nA government campaign to liberate Mosul and surrounding areas in Nineveh province began in mid-October. More than two months later, the only major fighting inside the city has been done by elite counter-terrorism forces, also known as the \u201cgolden division\u201d.\nSince the new offensive began, the special forces have pushed forward in at least two neighborhoods in the city\u2019s eastern sector, while the army\u2019s ninth and 16th divisions also made headway south and north of the capital respectively.\nThe ninth division was joined by units of the militarized federal police, while the 16th was bolstered by army units.\n\u201cI think the forces right now, the Iraqi security forces, as we sit here today on 1 January 2017, are at their peak and I think they will continue to improve because of the lessons they are learning on a daily basis,\u201d said Uribe, whose official title is deputy commanding general \u2013 Baghdad of the combined joint forces land component command.\nUribe said Iraqi forces, backed by a US-led coalition, would face a different fight when they crossed to the west bank of the Tigris River, saying it would mostly be a \u201cdismounted\u201d battle fought in part on narrow streets, some of which were not wide enough for a vehicle to pass.\n\u201cIt will be a different fight and they will adjust as they go from the east to the west. They are already planning these adjustments,\u201d he said.\n'A more dangerous long-term threat': Al-Qaida grows as Isis retreats Read more\nHe praised Iraqi security forces for what he said was going out of their way in Mosul to protect civilians.\n\u201cThey have been extremely good at taking care of those civilians. I don\u2019t know whether you would have seen this a few years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was part of the training [by the coalition]. You got to treat people with dignity and respect. You cannot go into a city and make it worse than before.\u201d\nIraqi authorities have advised the estimated 1 million civilians believed to be still inside Mosul to stay in their homes until the city is fully liberated, but fears of getting caught in the crossfire between government forces and the militants have forced at least 120,000 residents to flee so far.\nMany are also leaving the city because they have run out of food and money, or due to a lack of essential services like water and power.", "lang": "en", "date_time": "2017-01-01T13:54:07", "intro": "Troops fighting Isis are adjusting well to changes on battlefield, says Brig Gen Rick Uribe as he suggests battle could last another three months", "topic": "Iraq|Mosul|Islamic State|Middle East and North Africa|news", "author": "Associated Press In Irbil", "source": "guardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/iraqi-forces-in-mosul-performing-at-their-peak-says-us-commander", "category": ""},

We publish the three winning entries\nHe\u2019d been travelling for just over three months but this was his final destination before returning home. The thought made him nauseous. There was not much waiting for him there except the high expectations of parents, which he had no idea how to meet. Join the family business, put that degree to good use, make some money and marry a nice girl. No thanks \u2013 he thought. Not me, there must be something better. But backpacking his way across a region, supposedly rich with history and opportunity, had done little to shed new light on how to escape his depressingly predictable destiny. As he pondered his predicament, he became aware of someone calling him \u2013 \u201cRon, Ron!\u201d \u2013 repeatedly until he finally snapped out of his daydream and turned to see his latest travelling companion, Kris, waving at him a few yards further up the busy street.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he grumbled his reply.\n\u201cYou need to come here right now and check this out,\u201d said Kris loudly, waving him over theatrically. People were glancing in his direction now. It was embarrassing.\n\u201cGo on then, what is it?\u2019 he snapped as he walked over \u2013 by now this country held few real surprises for him. Shitty food, people so hard to read, and the dreadfully embarrassing countrymen who seemed to pop up at every tourist attraction and guesthouse.\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Kris pointing, \u201ceven more beggars than we saw yesterday. Where do they all come from, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d\nZika, drought, conflict: what 2016 meant for the world's poorest \u2013 podcast Read more\nRon could see what he meant. There was a fairly big group of them, a dozen perhaps. They looked particularly incongruous in the city\u2019s high-end shopping district. Dirty, and a little threatening, despite the kids they had with them. Babies on laps and filthy toddlers in badly fitting clothes. One of these children even had a Manchester United shirt on. It made Ron want to laugh at the absurdity of it all. They were hanging around by a bus stop with its garish corporate advertising, this one showing a perfect little family grinning as they ate some processed food out of bowls.\nSome of the beggars just chatted but others sat and stared intently at the passing crowd. They had a sign with them \u2013 words scrawled on a battered piece of cardboard. Ron could not make out what was written and did not want to stare too long. These people always targeted the foreigners. He was sick of it.\n\u201cSad, eh?\u201d said Kris. \u201cI mean, surely when you have a load of rich folk or whatever marching about spending a fortune in all these shops, driving nice cars, you shouldn\u2019t still have poverty like this.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose, but it\u2019s been the same everywhere. What do you expect?\u201d answered Ron. \u201cAnd anyway they\u2019re refugees, aren\u2019t they? Come on, this is the main shopping area. We came here to get geared up \u2013 what is it you\u2019re looking for?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know \u2013 not much good at shopping.\u201d Kris shrugged. \u201cWhat\u2019s this place good for?\u201d\n\u201cClothes, I would imagine,\u201d answered Ron. \u201cI might get some music or something.\u201d\nKris laughed loudly and some of the locals stared. \u201cMusic! For goodness sake, who buys music in a shop? Even here! Just download it.\u201d\nRon felt humiliated so lashed out. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll just want to buy something for that girlfriend of yours?\u201d He knew all too well that Kris was on the rebound.\nKris just glowered and showed him the finger. \u201cVery mature,\u201d Ron muttered.\nIn the end the two decided to part company and do their own thing for a while. Ron felt relieved. You travel halfway round the world feeling a little lonely and homesick, then you meet someone from your own country who seems to be from a similar background, hang out \u2013 and then quickly discover being with them 24/7 is unbearable. He\u2019d never been concerned about travelling on his own; you meet more people that way, he\u2019d told his worried-looking mother, but he had not reckoned on most of them being clowns.\nAs he made his way up the street, the crowds seemed to get thicker and thicker. They jostled past him, but he was used to that. He cut his way through but somehow everyone seemed to walk with a purpose, whereas he ambled along and, now and again, changed direction as something caught his eye. This seemed to cause confusion. No one met his gaze, but he was occasionally pushed and shoved and at one point he had his foot painfully stepped on. He had been told this was the spot in the city for shopping but he was still amazed at how busy it was, despite all that he had heard about the increasingly desperate economic situation. Everyone just seems to shop, he thought to himself. Perhaps it makes them feel better? There were of course many foreign faces like his own; most seemed to stride along with a purpose, like they knew exactly where they were going.\nHe turned into a small side street to catch his breath. As he made his way down the narrow lane he found himself outside some sort of textiles shop and decided to step inside to get even further away from the hubbub. The small boutique was pleasantly calm inside but he was almost immediately approached by a pushy salesman.\n\u201cWhat is it you are looking for, sir?\u201d he asked, a forced smile on his face. Why couldn\u2019t they just leave him alone? He was sure he was being overcharged wherever he went because of the colour of his skin, and he certainly had bought several items he did not need and did not really have room for in his luggage.\n\u201cWell, er, hmm, you know \u2013 just looking for something for my mother.\u201d The words came out before he\u2019d really decided how he was going to respond. It was true, he did need a gift for Mum but what on earth was this place going to provide? It was hardly a souvenir shop. There were plenty of textile shops at home. But the salesman was off, pointing things out and encouraging Ron to rub various materials between his fingers, make admiring noises about the colours.\nAfter what felt like an hour but was actually 10 minutes, he finally escaped complete with a red pashmina, gift-wrapped. At least it would not take up much room in his bag. Feeling slightly embarrassed by his purchase, and his inability to manage even the nicest and most gently spoken shop people, he quickly made his way further down the backstreets, following several twists and turns. It was not until he was pulling his phone from his pocket to call Kris to find where they were meeting for lunch, as per an earlier plan, that he realised his surroundings looked entirely unfamiliar. Surely he could not have strayed that far from the main shopping precinct? Damn it, he thought. Lost again.\nRon\u2019s ability to get lost was almost legendary. At school he was subject to much teasing from the other boys for being clueless when it came to navigating the busy city in which he spent his entire childhood.\n\u201cHey man \u2013 lost again, ha ha!\u201d they\u2019d call out, if he was ever late for class, before the teacher quietened them down and ordered him, shamefaced, to his seat. Now, at the age of 23, he was still teased by friends, girlfriends and family about his lack of any sense of direction.\nHis father had humiliated him in front of his aunties and uncles, brothers and sisters and all those that had gathered to see him off back in the spring, by presenting him with a map and a compass. \u201cTo help you find your way, son,\u201d he laughed, and everyone joined in mocking him. Some even clapped.\n\u201cJust follow all the other people who look like you,\u201d shouted his older brother, laughing. He blushed at the memory. A first-class computer science graduate and they just sodding laughed. He fumed when he thought about it.\nThe street he found himself in looked quite depressing on this grey overcast day, and the sidewalk was littered with filth \u2013 uncollected rubbish, broken glass and dog mess. He looked properly at his surroundings. Boarded-up shopfronts, dwellings with grimy windows and scruffy front entrances, overgrown with weeds. Where the hell was he? This did not look like the city centre. He stared at his mobile phone. Oh great, he thought. No signal \u2013 again. Why was he not surprised? Either his phone was out of charge or the signal had gone. No Google maps then, he grimaced. He was reminded yet again of the joke map his father had presented to him. It was not even of the right bloody country, never mind the right city.\nHe was so busy thinking about whether he could retrace his steps, while still brooding over his humiliation back home, that he did not see the two men approaching him from behind. The first he knew about their presence was when one grabbed him by the shoulder and spun him around. The other shouted, \u201cOK, we\u2019ll have that!\u201d The phone was snatched from his hand.\n\u201cYou rich foreigners don\u2019t need it anyway. You can just buy another.\u201d Both were young \u2013 perhaps in their late teens \u2013 and one, to Ron\u2019s horror, carried an ugly-looking little blade. Ron felt his guts lurch and bile rising in his throat.\n\u201cMoney!\u201d barked the taller of the two, while his knife-carrying colleague looked nervously about. Ron did not speak, just handed over his money and cards. His hand shook as he held them out and they were snatched from him. And then the men were gone. They had fled around the corner so fast he hardly saw them go. Afterwards, he struggled to remember what they had been wearing or their faces. They all looked the same to him anyway. He remembered the glint of the knife, though, and the thick accent of the taller one who spoke. Those memories visited him in his dreams for a long time afterwards.\nIt was not until after the meeting with the bored-looking police officer, a woman, the successful attempt to reach his distraught parents and, on the following day, the wiring of money and the purchase of a cheap phone, that Ron was able to get his stuff together for the trip home. As for Kris \u2013 well, he lost his number along with his iPhone, and he never saw him back at the accommodation. He was a loser anyway, and it was not as if he ever tried to contact Ron again.\nIt was later that evening, while he packed, that he found the pashmina under his bed. It was still in its carefully folded paper gift wrapping, in the bottom of a crumpled plastic shopping bag with little white handles and the store\u2019s logo printed on the side. He\u2019d clutched that bag right through the robbery. He had not even noticed he was carrying it and his assailants also seemed to have ignored it. Funny really, he thought. Then he burst into tears, sitting down heavily on the side of his hotel bed, putting his head in his hands. The shock of what had happened to him the day before finally hit him.\nGod, he missed home so much. This country had overwhelmed him, with its crass commercialism, bizarre cultures and behaviours, and its misplaced arrogance \u2013 particularly towards foreigners. He just wanted to get away. He did not care if it was steeped in shared history and was great for your Christmas shopping. Surely, all the hype around it was misplaced. Why did so many come here \u2013 even stay? It was beyond him.\nTwelve hours later, he was heaving his rucksack through the airport, casting his gaze from left to right toward the other side of the arrivals gate to see if he could spot his father\u2019s driver. There he was. Good. Right on time. The heat, noise and smells of home hit him as they left the terminal together.\nAs he sat in the back seat staring out at all the familiar sights he felt depressed once again. What the hell was he going to do? His trip really had changed nothing. Three countries visited, many new experiences notched up, and for what? Maybe his parents were right. All this backpacking, pretending you are poor, when really you could go and dine in the finest restaurant, check into a five-star hotel, or just fly home whenever you wanted, really was a waste of time. Worse, it was a lie.\nThey were now in the city centre, passing the columns and glass of the railway station, less than a mile from his parents\u2019 apartment. The car ground to a halt yet again. The traffic certainly had not improved since he\u2019d left.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the hold-up now, Gopal?\u201d he asked the driver.\n\u201cVery sorry, Mr Rahul, sir. There is a cow at the top of the street holding everything up.\u201d\nRon stared into Paharganj \u2013 now there is a crowded neighbourhood, he thought. He could see many western tourists strolling up and down and being hassled by hawkers and beggars. God, the last few times he had been down there were when he and his school friends used to go and buy fireworks for Diwali. Bloody dreadful place. What made people leave their own comfortable homes to visit such shitholes? He tried to remember the phrase he heard his father use despairingly once, when describing these young visitors to his country. What was it? \u201cDevelopment tourists,\u201d that was it. What a joke.\n\u201cJust drive around, Gopal,\u201d he instructed the driver. The car slowly edged forward, horns blaring all around. No place like home, he thought.

[It] has not been used since 1975.\n\u201cThe symbolic value of non-renewal will be especially strong in the minority [republican/nationalist] community, to whom the power of detention has always been a particular irritant.\u201d\nBoth police and the general officer commanding, the senior army officer in the province, agreed with Atkins\u2019s assessment. The chief constable said it was a \u201cmatter of fine judgment\u201d. On the memo, Thatcher wrote in felt tip pen: \u201cIt will be seen as a sign of weakness if it lapses now.\u201d\nAtkins stood his ground and secured the support of the defence secretary, Francis Pym. \u201cShould a seriously deteriorating security situation point to a need to use the power,\u201d Atkins argued, \u201cit could be renewed.\u201d\nThatcher gave way. In a comment on a later letter from Atkins, the prime minister noted: \u201cI still think it is unwise but S of S [secretary of state] must follow his own decision and stand to it.\u201d", "lang": "en", "date_time": "2016-12-30T07:00:26", "intro": "PM failed to overrule ministers proposing non-renewal of section of Northern Ireland Act on detaining terrorists without trial", "topic": "Margaret Thatcher|Conservatives|Northern Ireland|Politics past|National Archives|news", "author": "Owen Bowcott", "source": "guardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/30/margaret-thatcher-gave-way-on-dropping-terrorist-detention-powers-northern-ireland", "category": ""},
{"title": "Where the supreme court battle goes from here: 'There will be a huge fight'", "content": "Donald Trump has promised to nominate a conservative in the mould of Antonin Scalia \u2013 but Democrats seem ready to battle to prevent that from happening\nWhere the supreme court battle goes from here: 'There will be a huge fight'\nJustice Samuel Alito listened intently as prosecutor Karl Racine made the case: \u201cCrooked Friar Laurence, with his small hands \u2026\u201d There was a lot more where that came from: jokes about \u201cbigly\u201d, \u201clow energy\u201d, building a wall, dodgy email servers and wayward opinion polls to get the audience laughing,\nTaking a break from his day job as a supreme court justice, Alito was presiding over the mock trial of Friar Laurence, accused of negligent and reckless conduct that led to the deaths of Romeo and Juliet, for the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington. The 66-year-old cut a genial and amused stage presence but left the most on-the-nose political gags to others.\nThe US could be vastly different a year from now. Here's how Read more\nIt was a sage decision in the current hyperpartisan climate. After the death of Alito\u2019s fellow conservative Antonin Scalia last February, Barack Obama nominated DC appeals court judge Merrick Garland to replace him. But the Republican-led Senate refused to consider his nomination, leaving the seat vacant so it could be filled by the winner of the presidential election.\nThe strategy was condemned as crude, cynical and inimical to the rule of law. It also worked. Now President-elect Donald Trump has promised to nominate a conservative in the mould of Scalia. Having previously released a list of 21 candidates, he said he had whittled the list down to \u201cprobably three or four\u201d. According to the incoming White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, Trump will announce his pick around the time of his inauguration on 20 January.\nIn theory that should mean the justice will take his or her seat at the start of April: current members of the court have faced an average of 71 days between nomination and confirmation. But the Garland case may have upended all protocol. Democrats, smarting over the way he was treated, could seek to throw sand in the gears for as long as possible.\n\u201cI think there will be a huge fight,\u201d said Marge Baker, executive vice-president at People For the American Way, a liberal advocacy group that intends to pressure Democrats. \u201cRepublicans totally threw out the playbook on President Obama\u2019s nomination; Merrick Garland was a moderate nominee. I can\u2019t imagine the Democrats will roll over and we\u2019ll certainly push them not to.\u201d\nSome Democrats, a minority in the Senate, seem ready to do battle. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon told MSNBC last month: \u201cThere\u2019s no legitimacy to a supreme court justice in a seat that\u2019s been stolen from one administration and handed to another. We need to do everything we possibly can to block it \u2026 it won\u2019t be DOA unless the American people understand that this is the theft of the court.\u201d\nThere is plenty to fire up liberals. Among the rumoured contenders are Bill Pryor, 54, who sits on the 11th circuit court of appeals and once described Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision making abortion legal, as the \u201cworst abomination in the history of constitutional law\u201d. Another is Diane Sykes, 58, who sits on the seventh circuit court of appeals and voted to uphold Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law \u2013 seen by some as crucial to Hillary Clinton\u2019s shock defeat in the state \u2013 as well as supporting businesses that challenged Obamacare over contraception access.\nBoth are relatively young and therefore good long-term investments, which Trump is said to favour. Like Scalia, both are originalists, which the late justice defined as interpreting the constitution as it was meant when adopted, not according to contemporary mores.\nBaker said: \u201cThey\u2019re among the most extreme and ideological activists on the federal bench. Judge Pryor would be devastating to the rights of women, LGBT Americans, and workers \u2026 Judge Skyes for her part has ignored constitutional protections, like the right to a fair trial and the right to vote, to push her far-right ideology.\u201d\nAt least eight Democrats will be required to give Trump\u2019s nominee the 60 votes needed for confirmation. But if they hold out and attempt to filibuster, Republicans may reach for the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of changing the rules to allow nominees to be confirmed by a simple majority vote. Democrats made a similar change for all judicial nominees except the supreme court in 2013.\nThe death of Scalia left the supreme court split between four conservatives and four liberals; if Trump\u2019s nominee is not confirmed before the end of March, it will be the longest vacancy in the modern era. The replacement is expected to restore the long-held conservative majority, whereas Clinton looked set to give liberals the edge. Potential issues at stake include abortion, the death penalty, immigration, religious rights, presidential powers and transgender rights.\nEdward Fallone, a professor at Marquette University School of Law \u2013 from which Sykes is a graduate \u2013 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said: \u201cIt will be Trump\u2019s way right out of the gate of giving conservatives something they want. If he compromises on other things, like immigration for example, giving them the supreme court nominee of their dreams will go a long way to shoring up his support.\u201d\nThe supreme court nomination may be a sideshow compared with Trump\u2019s choice of attorney general, Jeff Sessions, a hardliner on immigration accused of making racist comments in the past. Nearly 150 outside groups are reportedly pressuring Senate Democrats to stop him.\nFallone added: \u201cThey have to recognise they can\u2019t block every appointment. They\u2019re going to have to concentrate their fire. Whoever Trump appoints can\u2019t be more conservative than Scalia: it restores the status quo.\u201d\nThe bigger question, he suggests, is what would happen if another justice, such as the liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83, has to be replaced during Trump\u2019s term. \u201cYou would probably still need an additional Trump appointment to overturn Roe v Wade. It may be the real fight is over the second Trump appointment, maybe after midterm elections when Democrats might be in a stronger position. They may decide this is one they can afford to let through.\u201d\nVincent Eng, a lobbyist whose clients include the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, agreed. \u201cDemocrats and liberals have to pick their battles,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see this selection as a big fight, as opposed to what will happen if Ginsburg goes.\u201d\nConservatives also believe the vacancy will be filled sooner rather than later. Curt Levey, an attorney with FreedomWorks and the Committee For Justice, said: \u201cYou\u2019re replacing Scalia so the court isn\u2019t going to be any further right than a year ago. When Anthony Kennedy or Ruth Bader Ginsburg retire, they\u2019ll fight hard.\n\u201cThe Republicans fought Merrick Garland because they faced armageddon. The Democrats are not facing armageddon here. My guess is they will give the nominee a tough ride but they won\u2019t filibuster; they could filibuster but they would lose.\u201d\nAs for Garland, on 18 January, two days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, he will resume hearing cases in his current position as chief judge of the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. At a recent Hanukkah reception at the White House, Obama welcomed him as \u201cone of the country\u2019s finest jurists\u201d.", "lang": "en", "date_time": "2016-12-31T12:00:27", "intro": "Donald Trump has promised to nominate a conservative in the mould of Antonin Scalia \u2013 but Democrats seem ready to battle to prevent that from happening", "topic": "US supreme court|Donald Trump|US politics|analysis", "author": "David Smith", "source": "guardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/31/donald-trump-supreme-court-picks-democrats-opposition", "category": ""},

There are also growing concerns in education that the government\u2019s silence will put off possible future recruits from the EU.\nDepartment for Education figures show that close to 5,000 teachers from EU countries qualified to teach last year, up from just over 2,000 in 2010. The largest numbers came from Spain, Greece, Poland and Romania. The number from Greece has shot up more than sixfold \u2013 from 88 to 572 \u2013 since 2010. Yet, despite the influx, the DfE has failed to hit necessary recruitment levels for a fifth year in a row, it was revealed last week. There were not enough trainee teachers starting courses this September in three-quarters of subjects, with maths, physics, design and technology, computing and business studies all falling.\nMeanwhile, more than 50,000 teachers left the profession before retirement last year, the highest number for more than a decade. More teachers are leaving the job than joining, with almost a quarter leaving within their first three years.\nShadow schools minister Mike Kane said he feared that the government\u2019s policy on EU nationals could further jeopardise schools\u2019 ability to fill staff shortages. \u201cThe Tories are failing to train enough teachers for our schools and it is EU teachers that are helping to plug the gap,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is appalling that the prime minister won\u2019t guarantee the legal status of these teachers that are helping with our skills shortages. It is our children that will pay the price for this shameless politicking.\u201d\nProfessor John Howson, a government adviser on teacher recruitment, said that in recent years, with pressures on funding, headteachers had looked to teachers from eastern Europe in particular to ease staffing shortages. He said: \u201cI suspect that quite a lot of recruitment agencies have been operating particularly in places like Romania and Bulgaria, where the standards in teaching maths are probably quite high.\u201d\nIn June, the cross-party public accounts committee of MPs criticised the DfE for having no plan to meet its targets.\nThe DfE claims to be investing more than \u00a31.3bn over this parliament \u201cto attract the brightest and best into teaching\u201d.

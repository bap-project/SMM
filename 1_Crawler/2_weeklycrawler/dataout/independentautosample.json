And the environment could suffer some of the worst after-effects. Trump, who takes office later this month, has sent mixed messages about climate change, but the overall mood music suggests he will reject the scientific consensus and allow fossil fuels to be burned like there's no tomorrow. Climate scientists have already described his election as a disaster for the world. A booklet called Handling Political Harassment and Legal Intimidation: A Pocket Guide for Scientists is even being distributed at the American Geophysical Union's annual conference, partly because of concerns that the Trump administration will attempt to interfere with science.\nWhether these fears are justified will likely become apparent over the next year, possibly from day one of the Trump presidency if he immediately fulfils his pledge to remove the US from the signatories of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Paris accord has been hailed as a landmark moment in human history and even, according to Barack Obama, what could be \u201cthe moment that we finally decided to save our planet\u201d. But the follow-up summit, the supposed \u201cconference of action\u201d held in Morocco in November at which the warm words of Paris would be turned into reality, was something of a damp squib in the eyes of some. Campaigners spoke of their extreme disappointment that the rich world was not doing enough to help poor countries cope with the effects of global warming.\nAt the Marrakesh summit, held as Trump was elected, many delegates insisted that his apparent climate-change denial \u2013 as evidenced by delusional comments that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by China \u2013 would not derail the world\u2019s efforts to tackle the problem. But it smacked a bit of professional optimism. \u201cDon\u2019t give up, it\u2019s not hopeless\u201d was the message they wanted to get across. If Washington suddenly drops its leadership role on climate change and champions fossil fuels instead, that would have a massive effect, both directly and as an example for other states to follow. Starting on 20 January, US officials, particularly the US military, which has long recognised the serious risks to world security posed by climate change, must show courage to vigorously challenge Trump\u2019s scepticism and attempt to convince him he is wrong.\nIn 2015, the city of York was flooded after heavy rain which became the worst it had suffered in a generation, where the River Ouse was 5.2m above its normal level ( Shuttercock )\nIt is a battle of wills likely to take place behind closed doors, but which could spill out into the open if he sticks to his guns. In the UK, which like the US has played a leading role in the international efforts to limit global warming, climate scepticism is of a milder brand, with the likes of Lord Lawson and Nicholas Ridley accepting much of the science but insisting it won\u2019t be as bad as the experts predict. The quality of their arguments \u2013 such gems as \u201cenvironmental predictions of doom\u201d simply \u201calways\u201d turn out to be wrong \u2013 leaves much to be desired.\nBut arch-Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg are already eyeing up the chance to slash environmental regulations after the UK leaves the European Union. Arrayed against them are the UK\u2019s environmental groups who have launched a campaign to make this country the greenest country in the world post-Brexit. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, pointed to the plummeting price of renewables and the pressure on the Government to act to control air pollution from fossil fuels as signs of hope. \u201cWhile many people have quite fairly seen 2016 as a horror show, especially with the election of Trump, there are reasons to be positive, \u201d he said. \u201cPeople are rightly nervous about 2017, but we will make sure our environment is not sacrificed for short-term corporate greed.\u201d\nTheresa May\u2019s position is somewhat unclear. Andrea Leadsom, picked by May as Environment Secretary, has said she only became convinced last year that climate change was real. But since becoming a Cabinet minister, she has been repeatedly parroting the mantra that the Government\u2019s ambition is for this generation to be the first to leave the natural world in a better state than they found it. The fuzzy language leaves plenty of wriggle room, but could be a genuine statement of intent. The proof should come over the next few months as the Government lays out its carbon emissions reduction plan, a 25-year plan for the environment and a separate 25-year plan for food and farming.\nThe Great Repeal Bill \u2013 required as part of the Brexit process \u2013 should also reveal how much EU environmental legislation is adopted into UK law and how much is ditched. May, an arch-pragmatist at a time when one is most certainly needed, may decide to pay little more than lip service to climate change and the environment while focussing on preventing Brexit from causing the economic collapse of the UK. Whether this threat is real or a phantom should become more apparent after Article 50 is triggered in the spring.\nResearchers predict 1,600 glaciers in Norway could completely melt over the next 100 years, meaning only 28 glaciers would be left in the country ( Shuttercock )\nWith the UK otherwise pre-occupied and the US in the grip of a climate denier, China\u2019s attitude to climate change will be increasingly important. China came to the realisation that climate change required serious action relatively late. It had good reasons to avoid confronting reality after largely running its rapidly growing economy on coal, but it has since become something of a world leader on renewable energy and announced its ratification of the Paris Agreement at a joint ceremony with the US. Over the next year it should become clear whether Beijing will stick to this path or slide back towards climate science denial and fossil fuels. If that happens, it could be game over for life as we know it on the planet as average global temperatures increase by Armageddon-like levels of 5-7C. A recent study suggested we might already be heading in that direction.\nSo 2017 is shaping up to be quite a significant year. Unless of course global warming does turn out to be the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on humanity by an evil cabal of virtually every scientist on the planet \u2013 all in the name of winning research grants. But if you believe that, you\u2019re probably still drunk.", "title": "After the drunken party, the hangover begins to bite"},

She uttered the infamous words back in 1987, but she could perhaps have been reflecting on the year ahead of us. As we enter 2017, is society dead?\nFor those who strive to build a strong British community, the events of the past 12 months paint a bleak picture. Brexit has left our nation more divided than at any time since Thatcher first made her pronouncement. Not only have attitudes towards immigration hardened in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, but hate crimes against those from racial or religious minorities have risen rapidly. Racist slurs many of us thought buried in the past are re-emerging, and there is a generation of children being defined by their ancestry rather than their potential. Meanwhile, the political rhetoric around immigration has hardened as politicians across the spectrum seek to fight the growth of the right on their own territory. It seems nobody is willing to welcome a stranger with open arms anymore.\nAcross the Atlantic, Donald Trump\u2019s message of individualism triumphed in the presidential election, with the social cornerstones of Barack Obama\u2019s eight-year administration \u2013 Obamacare, in particular \u2013 now at risk of repeal. Back at home, the promotion of Theresa May from Home Secretary to Prime Minister ignited a candle of hope for some. Her victory speech on the steps of Downing Street promised that she would govern for the many, not the few. She emoted over the plight of the \u201cjust about managing\u201d. But then we got to her first Autumn Statement, and the Chancellor had given nothing away.\nAfter the adjustment in that statement, a couple with two children under the age of four who are both working (one full-time, one part-time) will be \u00a32,000 a year worse off by 2020 according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. What about those coping single-handedly? A single parent with one child under four, working full-time on the minimum wage, would be \u00a33,800 worse off by 2020 as a result of the measures announced by both David Cameron and May during this parliament.\nWe can see the results of these decisions, and our changing attitudes, in the degradation of our society. Homelessness, particularly street-sleeping and sofa-surfing, is on the rise. There were 120,000 children homeless or living in temporary accommodation this Christmas; as 2017 begins these children have no stability, and will be shunted around by councils and other officials in an attempt to find them what scarce housing there is, risking their education as a result.\nTrussell Trust Constitution Street food bank ( Getty )\nBetween April and September 2016, Trussell Trust food banks across the UK handed out 519,342 three-day emergency food parcels to families in crisis \u2013 feeding 188,584 children \u2013 compared to 506,369 last year. So what happened to our society? Are we finally living in the world that Thatcher predicted, perhaps just a little before her time?\nHer remarks, however, had a second element. \u201cThere is no such thing as society, \u201d she said, adding, \u201cthere are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people.\u201d\nThe government, and politics in general, may have abandoned its commitment to society, but ordinary people have not. The Trussell Trust may have handed out emergency food supplies to more than half a million people, but that has required the support of thousands of volunteers and food donors. Shoppers are gifting their excess purchases to local food banks, while volunteers are spending hours sorting food, distributing it and giving advice and support to those who find themselves in desperate need.\nMeanwhile, though firm figures are hard to come by, charities such as the Boaz Trust in Manchester, which finds temporary homes for refugees, reports large numbers of people coming forward to open their homes to desperate people fleeing conflict in Syria and elsewhere. They are stepping in while politicians are stumbling back.\nOur ageing population \u2013 so often a cause for concern, with commentators bemoaning the neglect of lonely older people and others witnessing the cruelty inflicted by our underfunded social care system \u2013 is a source of social good. More than 14 million people in Britain now volunteer at least once a month, according to the National Council of Voluntary Organisations, many of them retired people keen to give something back. Most give at least 11 hours of their time each and every month to a local cause.\nAs we enter 2017, we sadly have to agree with Thatcher on one point: society is no longer the same as the state. But even though the state is walking away from its social and moral obligations, that alone does not mean society is dead. Rather, the state needs to catch up once again with the society the rest of us are building.", "title": "Is society dead?"},

In this moment he [Mkhitaryan] even plays left-back when the team is winning, to defend with a little bit more balance.\n\u201cAnthony has to listen to me and not his agent. He has to listen to me. He has to listen to me in training every day, in every feedback I give to try to improve players. The Mkhitaryan process, I was having almost every day Mkhitaryan\u2019s agent calling me and saying he will be a better player with you, keep going.\n\u201cWith Martial, every day I read the newspaper; Martial goes to Sevilla, Martial goes on loan, Martial is not happy. Martial has to listen to me. He is a player with amazing conditions to be a top player.\u201d\nOn his side\u2019s fifth successive league victory, Mourinho added: \"We managed to do something that is amazing which is to bring the fans to the pitch, I think we did that in the last 15-20 minutes. We played with 70,000. We played with them, they were on the pitch. It was too much for a very organised team [Boro]. It was phenomenal. The fans were on the pitch. It was a very good match to finish the year.\u201d\nManchester United transfer targets\n6 show all Manchester United transfer targets\n1/6 Jose Gimenez (Atletico Madrid) The 21-year-old Uruguayan has already played 21 times for his country and has been touted as a future world-class centre-back. Currently on the books of Atletico Madrid, Gimenez is not a regular and a move in January for first-team football would surely appeal to him. Getty\n2/6 Victor Lindelof (Benfica) The most recent player to be linked with the Red Devils, Lindelof is a 22-year-old centre-back currently plying his trade at Benfica. The Swedish international has been in fine form this season and could be tempted by a move to England in January. Getty\n3/6 Mesut \u00d6zil (Arsenal) The German midfielder has emerged as a shock transfer target for the Red Devils as the Arsenal playmaker demands a substantial increase to his current \u00a3140,000 per week contract in North London. Getty\n4/6 Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid) The French forward had a brilliant season in Spain last year and was top scorer and Player of the Tournament as he helped his country to the final of Euro 2016. Atletico Madrid would certainly not let him go on the cheap however. Getty\n5/6 Yannick Carrasco (Atletico Madrid) The third Atletico Madrid player reported to be on Mourinho\u2019s wish-list, Carrasco is one of Belgium\u2019s new generation of talent and, at just 23 years of age, has a long career ahead of him. The Belgian is an attacking midfielder who has added a ruthlessness in front of goal to his repertoire this season, contributing nine goals in all competitions. Getty\n6/6 Bruma (Galatasaray) Galatasaray\u2019s fleet-footed winger is rated at around \u00a321.5m and has impressed in the Turkish league this season, receiving five Man of the Match awards in just ten starts so far. Bruma is a fantastic dribbler who would certainly provide competition for places on the left wing. Getty\nSir Alex Ferguson was in the stands on his 75th birthday and Old Trafford was rocking by the end. Aitor Karanka, Mourinho\u2019s former apprentice at Real Madrid, praised Middlesbrough\u2019s performance and said there were many positives despite the result.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to lose but I thought the performance was really good against a top team. Once again we\u2019ve competed against a top team, we were winning with five minutes to go,\" he said.\n\u201cWe had a consistent game and we had chances to score.

She would be following in the footsteps of another pioneer of women\u2019s MMA, Gina Carano, who retired from the sport in 2009 and has since featured in films such as Fast & Furious, Fight Girls and Deadpool.\nIt\u2019s good work if you can get it, but whether it\u2019s as much of an option as it was before last evening in Las Vegas remains to be seen.\nWWE\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment have made it no secret that they would like to work with Rousey in the future.\nThe former UFC bantamweight champion made an appearance at WrestleMania back in 2015 when she confronted both Triple H and Stephanie McMahon inside the ring alongside The Rock.\nRousey appeared at WrestleMania in 2015 (WWE)\nThe clip of the confrontation instantly went viral and ever since the WWE haven\u2019t been shy in letting everyone know that they want to work with Rousey on a much grander scale.\nEven if Rousey doesn\u2019t end up quitting MMA, the WWE is still a massive option for her going forward. Don\u2019t be surprised if it happens as early as next year.\nShe keeps on fighting\u2026\nRousey may have suffered two of the highest profile losses in the sport in a row, but let\u2019s not forget what she had done prior to that where she\u2019d gone on a tear of twelve unbeaten matches and destroyed everything in her path.\nAt the end of the day, Ronda Rousey is known for being a true competitor, a pioneer for the sport and an inspiration to women all over the world. Forgetting what she\u2019s done previously in her career would not only be unfair, but it would be foolish\u2014make no bones about it this woman is as competitive as they come and she will be hurting inside sorely once again after last night.\nRousey remains one of the most dominant champions seen in UFC history (Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC )\nThat said, having gone through the media blackout this week leading up to her return it\u2019s almost impossible to determine where her mental state is right now.\nThere are so many questions we wished we had answers for: was she really focused on the fight? Did she prepare to the best of the capabilities? How did she feel during fight week? Was she carrying any injuries? And perhaps most importantly \u2026 how are you feeling now Ms Rousey?\nRonda Rousey needs to wake up in the morning\u2014look at herself in the mirror and ask a very simple question; am I still a fighter?\nRousey has now suffered two brutal defeats in succession ( Getty )\nIf the answer is no, she needs to retire now and ride off into the sunset pursuing either of the two options mentioned above with her +$3 million-dollar check from last night burning in her pocket.\nHowever, if the woman staring back at her is motivated to right the wrongs and prove to the world she\u2019s still one of the best on the planet then she needs to make fundamental changes.\nFirstly, her coach Edmund Tarverdyan needs to step aside and she needs to find a top camp to go train at. Once again last evening, Tarverdyan\u2019s cornering was beyond ridiculous. His instructions were shouted not in a calm way to relax his fighter, but rather with the tone of a distressed father watching his child taking a beating. The clips are out there on social media and it\u2019s frankly embarrassing.\nRousey\u2019s positioning, countering, distance management and just overall striking technique was shown up by Holly Holm thirteen months ago, and last evening there were zero signs of her making improvements.\nRousey's striking technique needs a lot of work after being exposed by Holm and Nunes (Getty)\nHer performance was very different from the way Conor McGregor handled defeat earlier this year. After being submitted by Nate Diaz in March, the Irishman worked on his cardio like a man obsessed and faced up to his shortcomings in both a humble and dignified way in the press.\nRousey was the opposite. She shunned everyone, blamed the media for causing her loss and last night proved she\u2019d not made the required developments since her first defeat.\nIf she continues, the high drawing fights would be rematches with Amanda Nunes or Holly Holm. The other big option would be the fight with Cris Cyborg, though that now would feel like sending a lamb to the slaughter and is a fight that should really never take place following the two devastating losses we just witnessed.\nSo where do we go from here then?\nIt\u2019s funny to say some time away from the spotlight is required given her lack of media work this week, but still some time away with her thoughts is the thing Rousey requires most right now.\nNo one can deny or ever take away from her what she\u2019s done for both the sport or women in general, but right now it feels like her mixed martial arts career is done. Should we see a return, it needs to be done with a significant amount of changes to both her training camp and the way she conducts herself with the MMA press.\nUFC retirement is the most likely option for Rousey - if she wants it (Getty)\nHer attitude this week wasn\u2019t something anyone enjoyed. Us press obviously disliked it, the UFC disliked it, and importantly most fans disliked it because they didn\u2019t get to see a side of her that we all enjoy\u2014her personality.\nThis week, Ronda Rousey was nothing more than a fighter who shunned everyone around her and who got ripped to pieces in under a minute.\nThat\u2019s not how I want to remember Ronda Rousey. Repression is real, but it\u2019s rarely granted to people in the public eye.\nNow we find out if Ronda Rousey is \u2018all about that thing\u2019, or if she\u2019s content with what she\u2019s already achieved and ready to leave the sport.\nRight here, right now I simply don\u2019t know the answer.", "title": "Ronda Rousey: What next for the UFC great?

Chelsea drew level with Arsenal\u2019s 2001-02 record by beating Stoke City 4-2 at Stamford Bridge, after which Conte praised his players for not taking their feet off the gas despite their brilliant run, and for refusing to be satisfied.\n\u201cThey showed great character, above all, after 12 wins in a row,\u201d Conte said. \u201cWhen you win a lot, there is a great danger to be satisfied. To be relaxed and to think that, in the end, we've won a lot in the past, and a draw, if we don't win, is not important.\u201d\nConte was delighted that his players had not shown this attitude and were motivated to keep winning, in pursuit of their historic record. \u201cMy players showed me great will, great will to fight, great will to win, great will to take this great achievement for us,\u201d Conte said. \u201cI'm pleased for them and they deserve this. I'm their coach, but they deserved this.\u201d\nChelsea were given a scare by a Stoke City side who levelled the game at 1-1 and 2-2 before Chelsea pulled away in the second half. Conte said that opponents were more motivated to beat Chelsea now, to end their run, and that this meant his team had to work even harder to keep winning.\n\u201cWe deserved to win this game\u201d Conte said. \u201cNow it's not easy after 13 wins in a row, you face teams that want to beat you, not only to take three points but for many reasons. It's more difficult. We must know this. But when you have this type of player, you can go to sleep happy.\u201d\nWhile Conte revels in the fact that his Chelsea team were \u201cunderestimated\u201d at the start of the season, he recognised the fact that they are now on a perch that opponents want to knock them off. \u201cIt is important to know it's not easy to repeat this run,\u201d Conte said. \u201cIt will be very difficult for us over what remains of this season. We started this season as underdogs, underestimated. And now we have the light of a great first part of the season on us. The light is on Chelsea. We must realise this and we have to work more, harder still, to find, game by game, the right solution to try and win. It won't be easy but, today, we are very happy.\u201d\nMark Hughes was pleased with Stoke\u2019s \u201cpositive performance\u201d, and said that the Premier League title would be a \u201cclose call\u201d between Chelsea and Jurgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool.\n\u201cLiverpool and Chelsea are completely different in their approach,\u201d Hughes explained. \u201cLiverpool are high intensity pressure from the off, high up the pitch. Chelsea are more cagey, allow you play in your own half, and then are devastating on the counter-attack. Two very different styles, but both very effective at the moment. Costa's performance today showed the value he gives to Chelsea. You wouldn't want Chelsea to lose him because that could significantly damage their ability to win the league. But It will be a close call between those two teams to win the league.\u201d", "title": "Chelsea vs Stoke: Antonio Conte delighted that record-equalling players refuse to be 'satisfied'"},

Among Black/Black British people, homelessness increased by 40 per cent, while 42 per cent more people classed as \u2018Chinese or Other Ethnic Group\u2019 were declared homeless.

It has increased rapidly since 2010 and is now at the highest level since 2005.\nThe figures relate to households that have been deemed unintentionally homeless and \"in priority need\". Councils have a legal duty to help these people, with the vast majority being placed into temporary accommodation \u2013 often in the form of crowded B&Bs or hostels.\nIt means thousands of ethnic minority people in Britain are being forced to live in temporary homes, where conditions are often cramped and very basic.\nChildren may be crammed into one room with little space to study or play. Siblings may have to share a bed and families share bathroom and kitchen facilities with strangers.\nThe figures were released as The Independent campaigns with the charity Centrepoint to raise funds for the first nationwide Young and Homeless Helpline, which will be able to offer assistance to the thousands of 16 to 25-year-olds who face homelessness in the UK every year.\nCurrently Centrepoint estimates that up to one in three young people seeking help because they are homeless or about to become homeless are turned away unaided by English local councils.\nThe causes of homelessness\n7 show all The causes of homelessness\n1/7 Family Breakdown Relationship breakdown, usually between young people and their parents or step-parents, is a major cause of youth homelessness. Around six in ten young people who come to Centrepoint say they had to leave home because of arguments, relationship breakdown or being told to leave. Many have experienced long-term problems at home, often involving violence, leaving them without the family support networks that most of us take for granted\n2/7 Complex needs Young people who come to Centrepoint face a range of different and complex problems. More than a third have a mental health issue, such as depression and anxiety, another third need to tackle issues with substance misuse. A similar proportion also need to improve their physical health. These problems often overlap, making it more difficult for young people to access help and increasing the chances of them becoming homeless Getty Images/iStockphoto\n3/7 Deprivation Young people's chances of having to leave home are higher in areas of high deprivation and poor prospects for employment and education. Many of those who experience long spells of poverty can get into problem debt, which makes it harder for them to access housing Getty Images/iStockphoto\n4/7 Gang Crime Homeless young people are often affected by gang-related problems. In some cases, it becomes too dangerous to stay in their local area meaning they can end up homeless. One in six young people at Centrepoint have been involved in or affected by gang crime Getty Images/iStockphoto\n5/7 Exclusion From School Not being in education can make it much more difficult for young people to access help with problems at home or health problems. Missing out on formal education can also make it more difficult for them to move into work Getty Images/iStockphoto\n6/7 Leaving Care Almost a quarter of young people at Centrepoint have been in care. They often have little choice but to deal with the challenges and responsibilities of living independently at a young age. Traumas faced in their early lives make care leavers some of the most vulnerable young people in our communities, with higher chances of poor outcomes in education, employment and housing. Their additional needs mean they require a higher level of support to maintain their accommodation Getty Images/iStockphoto\n7/7 Refugees Around 13 per cent of young people at Centrepoint are refugees or have leave to remain, meaning it isn't safe to return home. This includes young people who come to the UK as unaccompanied minors, fleeing violence or persecution in their own country. After being granted asylum, young people sometimes find themselves with nowhere to go and can end up homeless Getty Images/iStockphoto\nBalbir Chatrik, the charity\u2019s director of policy and engagement, said the increases in homelessness among ethnic minorities were linked to the difficulties members of these communities still faced in getting jobs.\nShe said: \u201cUnfortunately, it is not surprising that the homelessness figures within black and minority ethnic (BME) communities are increasing.\n\u201cWhile there are many contributing factors to homelessness, the one dominant feature within these communities is a high rate of unemployment. For many years it has been apparent that it\u2019s much harder for young people within BME communities to gain employment, and this can have a direct impact on their housing situation.\u201d\nShe added that Centrepoint, which achieves 90 per cent positive outcomes with the young people it assists, was doing what it could to address these, and other imbalances:\n\u201cAt Centrepoint, we believe very strongly in long term solutions. We work closely with every young person that comes to us to build up their skills to enable them to get a job or support them back into college. Only with a secure grounding can housing be properly addressed.\u201d\nJeremy Corbyn attends homeless appeal event\nLabour said the figures were a direct result of Government spending cuts falling disproportionately on minority communities.\nDawn Butler MP, the Shadow Minister for Diverse Communities, said: \u201cLast month we learned that the Conservative cuts affected working households of African Caribbean Asian and minority ethnic women more than any other group.\n\"I highlighted that this would have a further impact on households and children of those groups. It's no surprise that when you take money out of the homes of African Caribbean and Asian and Minority ethnic women the end result will be more BAME people being made homeless.\u201d\nOfficial homelessness statistics are released quarterly by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and record how many households have been accepted by local authorities as being \u201cin priority need\u201d and homeless through no fault of their own. The Independent compared the figures for the third quarter of 2010 with the third quarter of 2016 \u2013 the latest period for which data is available.\nThe Government said it was already acting to tackle homelessness.\nA DCLG spokesman said: \u201cThis Government is committed to supporting the most vulnerable in our society and ensuring our country works for everyone.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re investing over \u00a3550 million to tackle and reduce homelessness, on top of supporting Bob Blackman\u2019s Homelessness Reduction Bill to prevent more people from becoming homeless in the first place.\"", "title": "Homelessness among ethnic minorities soars under Conservative government, new analysis reveals"},

The lessons are clear for all in the last year, from the lessons of Libya to Yemen and Syria.\n\"The SNP have consistently called for a wider strategy rather than knee-jerk militarism and we will continue to hold the Tory government to account on these crucial issues.\"\nMs May\u2019s administration has previously rejected calls by two parliamentary committees for it to stop the sale of British bombs to Saudi Arabia\u2019s armed forces in Yemen.\nSaudi forces have been widely accused of committing war crimes during the campaign in the country, where reports on the ground suggest they have blown up international hospitals, funerals, schools, and weddings.\nBut despite the reported incidents and the worsening humanitarian situation in the country since the bombardment began, the UK has signed off \u00a33.3 billion in arms sales to the country since the start of the offensive.\nSpeaking in the Commons in December Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, confirmed that British-made cluster bombs \u2013 last delivered in 1989 and outlawed in 2010 \u2013 have been used by the Saudi forces in the current conflict in Yemen. Due to their extraordinary risk to civilians, cluster bombs, which release small bomblets over a wider area, were banned in an international treaty signed by Britain.\nMeanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish First Minister, said she was determined that Scotland\u2019s vote to remain in the EU will be respected in her own message for 2017. The SNP leader added that a second vote on Scottish independence remains \u201chighly likely\u201d.\nThe First Minister said: \"We are working to safeguard the opportunities that so many people in Scotland now take for granted.\n\"We are determined that Scotland's vote to remain in the European Union will be respected - and that people in Scotland retain as many of the benefits of EU membership as possible, including the freedom to work, travel and study in other member states.\n\"New year is inevitably a time when we look to the future. I'm determined to ensure that we give our children and young people - Scotland's future - the support and care they need to live happy, healthy, fulfilling lives.\n\"I'm confident that in 2017, we will make further progress towards that goal. That's something which is well worth looking forward to.\n\"So, wherever you are - whether you're here in Scotland or further afield; whether you're at work, spending time on your own or with your friends or family - I hope you have a wonderful Hogmanay and a great new year.
